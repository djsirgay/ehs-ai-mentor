INTRODUCTION\nChemicals have become an important element \nof almost every aspect of modern life. All \nof these chemicals—from cleaning fluids to \npharmaceuticals, pesticides, and paints—are \nproduced in workplaces, and may be used in \nworkplaces downstream. While these chemicals \nhave utility and benefits in their applications, they \nalso have the potential to cause adverse effects. \nThese adverse effects include both health hazards \n(such as carcinogenicity and sensitization), and \nphysical hazards (for example, flammability and \nreactivity properties). In order to protect workers \nfrom these effects—and to reduce the occurrence \nof chemical source illnesses and injuries—\nemployers need information about the hazards of \nthe chemicals they use, as well as recommended \nprotective measures. Workers have both a right \nand a need to know this information too, especially \nso that they can take steps to protect themselves \nwhen necessary.\nNo one knows exactly how many chemicals may be \npresent in American workplaces. The total number \nof chemical substances that have been developed \nand registered in the Chemical Abstracts Service \nRegistry reached 60 million in 2011—the last 10 \nmillion of those were added in less than two years. \nMany of them involve innovations such as the \napplication of nanotechnology.\nWhile not all of these chemicals are produced \ncommercially today, this vast number indicates the \nscope of the potential problems in workplaces with \nregard to the safe use of chemicals. In addition, \nmost chemical substances are formulated into \nmixtures for use in the workplace. Therefore, the \nnumber of unique chemical mixtures is far greater \nthan the number of substances, and most workers \nare exposed to mixtures.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics \n(BLS), acute illnesses and injuries due to chemical \nexposures in the workplace have decreased \n42% since the Hazard Communication Standard \nwas first promulgated.The scope of workplaces in which chemical \nexposures occur is also very broad. While \nmost people can readily associate working in a \nchemical manufacturing plant as being a job that \ninvolves chemical exposures, there are many \nother types of facilities where such usage is also \ncommonplace. For example, construction workers \nmay be exposed to paints, lacquers, thinners, \nasphalt fumes, or crystalline silica. Hair stylists are \nexposed to chemical dyes and other hair products \nthat contain hazardous chemicals. All of these \ntypes of exposures are of concern in terms of \nprotecting workers, and ensuring that chemicals \nare used safely.\nAudience for this Guide\nThis guide is intended to help small employers \ncomply with the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration’s (OSHA) Hazard Communication \nStandard (HCS). The guide is advisory in nature \nand informational in content. It is not itself a \nstandard or regulation, and it creates no new \nlegal obligations. The employer must refer to the \nappropriate standard to ensure it is in compliance. \nIn 25 states and two territories, OSHA standards \nare enforced by the state agency responsible \nfor the OSHA-approved state plan. These states \nare: Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Indiana, \nIowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, \nNevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, \nPuerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, \nVermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming. \nConnecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and \nthe Virgin Islands operate OSHA-approved State \nPlans that apply only to state and local government \nemployees. State plans must adopt and enforce \nstandards that are either identical to or at least as \neffective as the Federal OSHA standards.\nOSHA’s Hazard Communication Standard\nOSHA’s HCS, 29 CFR 1910.1200 , addresses \nthe informational needs of employers and \nworkers with regard to chemicals. The HCS \nwas first promulgated in 1983, and covered the \nmanufacturing sector. It was later expanded to \ncover all industries where workers are potentially \nexposed to hazardous chemicals. \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration 2\nThe revised Hazard Communication Standard is \nexpected to build on the success of the original \nHazard Communication Standard and prevent an \nestimated additional 585 injuries and illnesses and \n43 fatalities annually. It will reduce trade barriers and \nresult in estimated annualized benefits in productivity \nimprovements for American businesses that regularly \nhandle, store and use hazardous chemicals, as well as \ncost savings for American businesses when revising \nsafety data sheets and labels for chemicals covered \nunder the standard.\nIn 2012, the HCS was modified to align its provisions \nwith the United Nations’ Globally Harmonized \nSystem of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals \n(GHS). Many benefits will result from revising the \nHCS to be consistent with the GHS. In particular, \nthe GHS helps to ensure that imported chemicals \nwill be accompanied by consistent hazard and \nprecautionary information to protect workers \nexposed in the U.S. In addition, the revised HCS can \nfacilitate trade in chemicals since it reduces potential \nbarriers posed by differing global requirements for \nclassification and labeling of chemicals.\n“Classification” means to identify the relevant data \nregarding the hazards of a chemical; review those \ndata to ascertain the hazards associated with the \nchemical; and decide whether the chemical will be \nclassified as hazardous according to the definition \nof hazardous chemical in this section.  In addition, \nclassification for health and physical hazards includes \nthe determination of the degree of hazard, where \nappropriate, by comparing the data with the criteria \nfor health and physical hazards.\n“Label” means an appropriate group of written, \nprinted or graphic information elements concerning \na hazardous chemical that is affixed to, printed on, or attached to the immediate container of a hazardous \nchemical, or to the outside packaging.\n“Safety data sheet (SDS)” means written or \nprinted material concerning a hazardous chemical \nthat is prepared in accordance with paragraph (g) \nof this section.The HCS is a unique OSHA standard in a number \nof respects. It incorporates what is referred to as \na downstream flow of information  from chemical \nmanufacturers, importers, and distributors, to \nemployers using the products: \n ■The standard requires chemical manufacturers \nand importers to classify  the hazards of the \nchemicals they produce or import, and to \nprepare appropriate labels  and safety data \nsheets  (SDSs) to convey the hazards, as well as \nrecommended protective measures. \n ■Chemical manufacturers, importers, and \ndistributors must ensure that the containers \nof these hazardous chemicals are labeled \nwhen shipped, and that SDSs are provided \ndownstream with the first shipment and when \nthe SDSs are updated.\nThus, those who know the most about the \nchemicals—the companies that produce, import, \nor distribute them—have the responsibility to \nassess available information, and convey what \nis needed to downstream employers where the \nhazardous chemicals are used. The scope of \ncoverage with regard to employers is addressed in \nparagraph (b)(2) of the standard:\n(b)(2) This section applies to any chemical which \nis known to be present in the workplace in such \na manner that employees may be exposed under \nnormal conditions of use or in a foreseeable \nemergency.\nThere are a number of definitions that impact \nthe interpretation of this definition of coverage \n(see box to the left), but most workplaces will be \nsubject to the rule. \nAs an employer who is a chemical user, you are \nrequired to receive labels and SDSs from your \nsuppliers. Employers have responsibilities under \nthe HCS to establish hazard communication \nprograms, and provide workers with access to \nlabels and SDSs, in addition to informing and \ntraining these workers. The responsibilities \nfor hazard communication are illustrated in  \nFigure 1.\nHazard Communication: Small Entity Compliance Guide for Employers That Use Hazardous Chemicals 3\n“Employee” means a worker who may be exposed \nto hazardous chemicals under normal operating \nconditions or in foreseeable emergencies. Workers \nsuch as office workers or bank tellers who encounter \nhazardous chemicals only in non-routine, isolated \ninstances are not covered.\n“Exposure or exposed” means that an employee \nis subjected, in the course of employment, to a \nchemical that is a physical or health hazard, and \nincludes potential (e.g., accidental or possible) \nexposure. “Subjected” in terms of health hazards \nincludes any route of entry (e.g., inhalation, \ningestion, skin contact or absorption.)\n“Produce” means to manufacture, process, formulate, \nblend, extract, generate, emit, or repackage.\n“Use” means to package, handle, react, emit, extract, \ngenerate as a by-product, or transfer.This guide addresses employer responsibilities \nunder the HCS. Many of the provisions of the \nstandard apply only to chemical manufacturers, \nimporters, or distributors. This guide will focus \non assisting employers that only use but do not \nproduce chemicals, in order to identify the parts of \nthe rule that apply to their facilities, and help them \nto develop and implement an effective hazard \ncommunication program. \nThe 2012 revisions to the HCS, also referred to as \n“HazCom 2012” in this document, primarily address \nhow chemical manufacturers and importers classify \nchemical hazards and prepare required labels \nand SDSs. If you are not a chemical manufacturer \nor importer, and you already have a hazard \ncommunication program that complies with the \noriginal HCS, you will have limited changes to make \nrelated to compliance with the revised standard. \nFigure 1: How Hazard Communication Works\n \n  \n \n  \n• Chemical \nManuf acturers and \nImporters classify \nthe hazards of \nchemicals they \nproduce or impor t, \nand prepare labels \nand safety data sheets based on the classifications\nChemicals ar e Shipped to  \nEmployers by  Chemical \nManuf acturers, Importers \nor Distr ibutorsImplement the\nProgram\n• All Employers recei ve \nlabeled container s and \nsafety data sheets with \nshipped c hemicals\n• All Employers must \nprepare a writ ten \nhazard communication \nprogram, including a list of the hazardous chemicals in the \nworkplaceEmployer s must ensure:\n•  All containers of \nhazardous c hemicals \nare labeled\n• Safety data sheets are \nmaintained for all hazardous c hemicals\n• Workers ar e trained \non program elements, hazards, protecti ve \nmeasures, etc.\nKeep Inf ormation\nUp-to-Date\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration 4\nIn order to understand the requirements of \nHazCom 2012 as applied to your workplace, it \nis useful to have a general familiarity with the \norganization of the standard. It is divided into \nregulatory paragraphs that describe requirements, \nwhich are further supplemented by appendices \nthat contain specific details.\nOrganization of the Regulatory Requirements \nfor Hazard Communication\nParagraphs  \nof the StandardAppendices  \nto the Standard\n(a) Purpose\n(b) Scope and \nApplication\n(c) Definitions\n(d) Hazard Classification\n(e) Written Hazard \nCommunication Program\n(f) Labels and Other \nForms of Warning\n(g) Safety Data Sheets\n(h) Employee \nInformation and Training\n(i) Trade Secrets\n(j) Effective DatesAppendix A , Health \nHazard Criteria \n(Mandatory) \nAppendix B , Physical \nHazard Criteria \n(Mandatory) \nAppendix C , Allocation \nof Label Elements \n(Mandatory) \nAppendix D , Safety Data \nSheets (Mandatory) \nAppendix E , Definition \nof “Trade Secret” \n(Mandatory)\nAppendix F , \nGuidance for Hazard \nClassifications re: \nCarcinogenicity \n(Non -Mandatory)  \nUnder the HCS, an employer must prepare and \nimplement a hazard communication program \nfor workers potentially exposed to hazardous \nchemicals. The requirements most relevant to this \nresponsibility can be found in paragraphs (e), (f), \n(g), and (h) as listed above and indicated in purple. \nThe other parts of the standard may provide some \nguidance on understanding the requirements \n(such as Paragraph (c) Definitions), but your \nresponsibilities are to employees in your workplace, \nand those responsibilities are specified in the \nstandard paragraphs highlighted in the table above.As previously mentioned, your suppliers must \nprovide hazard information in the form of labels on \ncontainers and SDSs when you receive a chemical. \nThe focus of the information is to provide the \nidentities and hazards of the chemicals, their \ncharacteristics and properties, and how potential \nadverse effects can be prevented. A “hazardous \nchemical”  means any chemical which is classified \nas a physical hazard or a health hazard, a simple \nasphyxiant, combustible dust, pyrophoric gas, or \nhazard not otherwise classified.\nIn addition to the health and physical hazards \nlisted above, there may be some hazards that do \nnot meet the specified criteria for the physical \nand health hazard classes provided in HazCom \n2012. In these cases, the chemical manufacturer or \nimporter will designate the hazards as “hazards not \notherwise classified” (HNOC), and must provide \ninformation on the SDS to ensure that downstream \nemployers are aware of these other effects and any \nappropriate protective measures.\nHCS Health and Physical Hazards\nHealth Hazards Physical Hazards\n•\tAcute toxicity\n•\tSkin corrosion/\nirritation\n•\tSerious eye damage/\neye irritation\n•\tRespiratory or skin \nsensitization\n•\tGerm cell \nmutagenicity\n•\tCarcinogenicity\n•\tReproductive toxicity\n•\tSpecific target organ \ntoxicity – single and \nrepeated exposure\n•\tAspiration hazard\n•\tSimple asphyxiant•\tExplosives\n•\tFlammable gases\n•\tFlammable aerosols\n•\tOxidizing gases\n•\tGases under pressure   \n•\tFlammable liquids\n•\tFlammable solids\n•\tSelf-reactive chemicals\n•\tPyrophoric liquids\n•\tPyrophoric solids\n•\tPyrophoric gas\n•\tSelf-heating chemicals\n•\tChemicals which in \ncontact with water, \nemit flammable gases\n•\tOxidizing liquids\n•\tOxidizing solids\n•\tOrganic peroxides\n•\tCorrosive to metals\n•\tCombustible dust\nHazard Communication: Small Entity Compliance Guide for Employers That Use Hazardous Chemicals 5\nHazCom 2012 refers to each of the defined hazards \nas a “hazard class.”   Most of these hazard classes \nare subsequently divided into one or more \n“hazard category(ies).”   This classification is \ndone by the chemical manufacturer or importer, \nand is based on the severity of the effect, and \nthe type of data available to indicate each effect. \nThis is important to employers because it leads \ndirectly to the information that is subsequently \nprovided on labels and SDSs for the chemical. For \nexample, there are four categories in the hazard \nclass for flammable liquids. These categories \nare based primarily on flashpoints, so the lower \nthe flashpoint, the more severe the effect. The \nwarnings provided on labels will reflect this \nseverity in different statements depending on \nwhich category the chemical falls into based on \nits flashpoint. The category itself does not appear \non the label, but it is available on the SDS for the \nemployer’s reference. As an example of hazard \ncategories under HazCom 2012, the following is \nthe criteria for categorizing chemicals classified as \nflammable liquids:\nCriteria for Flammable Liquids\nCategory Criteria\n1 Flash point < 23°C (73.4°F) and initial \nboiling point ≤ 35°C (95°F)\n2 Flash point < 23°C (73.4°F) and initial \nboiling point > 35°C (95°F)\n3 Flash point ≥ 23°C (73.4°F) and  \n≤ 60°C (140°F)\n4 Flash point > 60°C (140°F) and  \n≤ 93°C (199.4°F)\nAs an employer who uses but does not \nmanufacture or import chemicals, you are not \nresponsible for making classifications or evaluating \nthe hazards of a chemical. You must receive a \nlabel and SDS from your supplier based on the \nclassification the supplier has made given the \navailable scientific data on the product. All of the \ncriteria used by the chemical manufacturer or \nimporter to perform the classification are provided \nin HazCom 2012 in Appendices A and B.Employers are allowed to perform their own \nclassifications if they choose not to rely on the \ninformation provided by the chemical manufacturer \nor importer. If you choose to perform your own \nclassification you will need to comply with the \nrequirements in Appendices A and B of the standard.\nIf you choose to rely on the classification \nperformed by the manufacturer or importer, it is \nnot necessary to be familiar with the criteria for \nclassifying the chemicals, or the scientific data \nsupporting classification. However, you must \nhave a basic understanding of the hazardous \neffects caused by the chemicals in your workplace. \nYou must also have such an understanding in \norder to use the information to select protective \nmeasures, and ensure proper management of the \nchemicals in your workplace. Additionally, you \nmust include information on the different types of \nhazards of the chemicals used in your workplace \nand how workers can protect themselves in your \ninformation and training program.\nCompliance Dates\nThe first compliance date of importance is \nDecember 1, 2013 . By that date, you must train \nyour employees about the format and presentation \nof the new labels and SDSs they will be seeing \nin the workplace. Over the course of several \nyears, your suppliers will be updating labels and \nSDSs to comply with the new requirements. It \nis, therefore, important to ensure that you and \nyour employees are able to access and use the \ninformation provided in the new approach. All new \nlabels and SDSs must be finished by June 1, 2015 ; \nhowever, if you order from a distributer you may \nstill receive labels compliant with HazCom 1994 \n(the hazard communication standard issued in \n1994 and replaced in 2012 by the revised standard) \nuntil December 1, 2015 . If an employer identifies \nnew hazards after December 1, 2015 due to the \nreclassification of the hazardous chemicals, it has \nsix months, until June 1, 2016 , to ensure that those \nhazards are included in the hazard communication \nprogram, workplace labeling reflects those \nnew hazards, and employees are trained on \nthe new hazards. During the transition from \ncurrent requirements to the new requirements, \nemployers may comply with either HazCom 1994 \nor HazCom 2012, both of which require a hazard \ncommunication program. \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration 6\nHazCom 2012 – Complete Schedule of Effective Dates\nEffective Completion Date Requirement(s) Who\nDecember 1, 2013 Train employees on the new label \nelements and SDS format.Employers\nJune 1, 2015  \n \nDecember 1, 2015Comply with all modified provisions of \nHazCom 2012, except:  \n \nDistributors may ship products labeled \nby the manufacturer or importer under \nthe old system until December 1, 2015.Chemical manufacturers, importers, \ndistributors and employers\nJune 1, 2016 Update alternative workplace labeling \nand hazard communication program \nas necessary, and provide additional \nemployee training for newly-identified \nphysical or health hazards.Employers\nTransition Period Comply with either HazCom 2012, \nHazCom 1994, or both.All chemical manufacturers, importers, \ndistributors and employers\nHazard Communication: Small Entity Compliance Guide for Employers That Use Hazardous Chemicals 7\nII.  STEPS TO AN EFFECTIVE \nHAZARD COMMUNICATION \nPROGRAM\nAll workplaces where workers are exposed to \nhazardous chemicals must have a written hazard \ncommunication program that describes how the \nHazCom standard is implemented in that facility. \nWhen hazard communication is implemented \neffectively, it has significant benefits for both \nthe employer and the workers in a workplace. \nEmployers need the information provided to them \nin order to assess the safety and health aspects \nof their workplace appropriately, and to select \nneeded control measures for the chemicals that \nare present. The information provided on SDSs \nmay also be used by employers to select the least \nhazardous chemical available to accomplish what \nis needed in the workplace. Substitution of a less \nhazardous chemical benefits workers because \nthey will not be exposed to the greater hazards, \nand benefits employers because they may have \nless need for controls in some situations. The \ninformation employers receive on labels and SDSs \nwill help them meet requirements for a safe and \nhealthful workplace.\nAn effective hazard communication program \nbenefits both workers and employers. The \ninformation provided by suppliers allows employers \nto design and implement a chemical safety and \nhealth management program.\nWorkers are entitled to the information about \nthe identities and hazards of the chemicals \nthey are potentially exposed to when working. \nWhen workers have such information, they are \nable to take steps to protect themselves, and \nto implement the controls their employer has \nselected for them. Knowing the health effects is important so that any signs or symptoms of \nexposure can be evaluated. Furthermore, being \naware of the chemicals and associated hazards \ncan help the worker determine how the exposure \nmay affect preexisting medical conditions. \nIn a survey conducted by the U.S. Government \nAccountability Office (GAO), approximately 30% \nof responding small businesses indicated they \nused information on SDSs to find less hazardous \nchemicals to use in their workplaces.\nSome employers view hazard communication as \nmerely a “paper exercise,” regarding compliance \nas just making sure that all the required labels and \nSDSs are available, but not using the information. \nHazard communication is much more than a \npaper exercise when implemented properly. The \nproper use of the information by employers to \ncontrol chemical exposure results in a decrease \nin illnesses and injuries caused by chemicals \nin the workplace—a clear benefit for exposed \nworkers. Effective hazard communication also \nhelps with effective management of chemicals in \nthe workplace, resulting in increased productivity, \ndecreased workers’ compensation costs, and other \nemployer benefits. \nThe HCS includes a three-part approach to \ncommunicating information to downstream \nemployers, as well as workers. \n ■Labeling containers of hazardous chemicals, \nwhich serves as an immediate warning of \nhazards\n ■SDSs, which are sources of detailed \ninformation on the hazardous chemical\n ■Training on the hazards\nAn effective hazard communication program can \nbe accomplished in six steps (Figure 2). \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration 8\nFigure 2:  Six Steps to an Effective Hazard Communication Program \n1.

The full regulatory \ntext can be found at: www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/\nHCSFinalRegTxt.html . \nAs noted above, the provisions that apply \nto employers simply using chemicals in the \nworkplace, rather than those that produce or \nimport chemicals, are found primarily in the \nfollowing paragraphs:\n(e) Written Hazard Communication Program; \n(f) Labels and Other Forms of Warning; \n(g) Safety Data Sheets; and \n(h) Employee Information and Training. \nYou can focus on the requirements in these \nparagraphs to determine what is needed for \ncompliance in your workplace. There may also be \nother provisions of the standard that help establish \ncompliance requirements in some workplaces. \nParagraph (b), Scope and Application , specifies \ntwo types of work operations where the coverage \nof the rule is limited. These are laboratories \nand operations where chemicals are only \nhandled in sealed containers (e.g., a warehouse). \nEmployers with these types of work operations \nhave reduced obligations under the HCS and \nbasically only need to keep labels on containers \nas they are received; maintain SDSs that are \nreceived, and give employees access to them; and \nprovide information and training to employees. Laboratories and operations where chemicals are \nonly handled in sealed containers do not have to \nhave written hazard communication programs and \nlists of chemicals.\nThe limited coverage for laboratories and sealed \ncontainer operations addresses your obligation \nto your own workers in the operations involved. \nHowever, when laboratory employers or employers \nwhere only sealed containers are involved \nact as chemical manufacturers, distributors \nor importers, they must fulfill their duties as \nsuppliers. For example, in warehouse operations \nwhere the employees are only exposed to sealed \ncontainers, paragraph (b)(4) of the standard would \napply. When these chemicals are distributed to \ndownstream users, paragraph (b)(4) requires the \ncompany to provide HazCom 2012-compliant labels \nand SDSs to downstream customers at the time of \nthe first shipment and when the SDS is updated. \nParagraph (c), Definitions , can be used to \ndetermine the meaning of some provisions in \nHazCom 2012 through the definitions provided for \nthe terms used in them. This guide will highlight \nsome of these definitions, but you may want to \nconsult the definitions for other terms to help \nensure you fully understand your compliance \nobligations in the workplace.\nHazard communication must be a continuing \nprogram in your facility. Compliance with the \nHCS is not a “one shot deal.”  In order to have \na successful program, it will be necessary to \nassign responsibility to staff for both the initial \nand ongoing activities needed to comply with \nthe standard. In some cases, these activities may \nalready be part of current job assignments. For \nexample, site supervisors are frequently responsible \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration 10\nfor on-the-job training sessions. Early identification \nof the responsible workers, and their involvement in \nthe development of your plan of action, will result in \na more effective program design. \nIn order to ensure you have an effective \nprogram and address all of the necessary \ncomponents, responsibility for implementation \nof hazard communication should be assigned \nto someone to coordinate. While different \npeople may be responsible for certain parts \nof implementation, there should nevertheless be someone who has overall responsibility. \nApproaching compliance consistently, and \ncomprehensively, is the key to success.\nThe person responsible for the overall coordination \nmay not be the best person to accomplish all \nof the elements. For example, training workers \nmay require different expertise than coordinating \ncompliance. The standard allows employers the \nflexibility to do what is best in their own facilities as \nlong as compliance with all elements is achieved.\nHazard Communication: Small Entity Compliance Guide for Employers That Use Hazardous Chemicals 11\n2.   Prepare and \nImplement a \nWritten Hazard \nCommunication \nProgram•\tPrepare a written plan to indicate how hazard \ncommunication will be addressed in your facility.\n•\tPrepare a list or inventory of all hazardous chemicals in \nthe workplace.\nParagraph (e), Written Hazard Communication \nProgram , requires employers to prepare and \nimplement a written hazard communication \nprogram. This does not need to be lengthy or \ncomplicated. The main intent of the requirement is \nto help ensure that compliance with the standard \nis done in a systematic way and that all elements \nare coordinated. Thus, the program must describe \nhow the employer will address the requirements \nof paragraphs (f) Labels and Other Forms of \nWarning; (g) Safety Data Sheets; and (h) Employee \nInformation and Training, in the workplace. A \nsample written program is provided in Appendix A \nof this guide.\nIn addition, the written program must include the \nfollowing items:\n ■Paragraph (e)(1): A list of the hazardous \nchemicals known to be present in the \nworkplace.  The list may be kept using any \nproduct identifier  from the SDS. Thus, the list \nmay be kept by product name, common name, \nor chemical name. The important aspect of \nthis requirement is that the term used on the \nlist must also be available on both the SDS \nand the label so that these documents can be \ncross-referenced. The list can be compiled in \nwhatever way the employer finds most useful \nand applicable to the workplace. A list of all \nhazardous chemicals in the entire workplace \nmay be most suitable for very small facilities, \nwhere there are few work areas and all \nworkers are potentially exposed to essentially \nthe same products. For larger workplaces, it \nmay be more convenient to compile lists of \nhazardous chemicals by work area and have \nthem assembled together as the overall list for \nthe workplace. The list is an inventory of chemicals for which \nthe employer must ensure that there is an \nSDS available. Compiling the list also helps \nemployers keep track of the chemicals present, \nand to identify chemicals that are no longer \nbeing used, and thus could be removed from \nthe workplace. Removing such chemicals may \nalso reduce potential adverse effects that could \noccur in the workplace.\nThe best way to prepare a comprehensive list \nmay be to survey the workplace. Purchasing \nrecords may also help and employers should \nestablish procedures to ensure that purchasing \nprocedures result in receiving SDSs before \na material is used in the workplace. Prior to \npurchasing chemicals, review the hazards of \nthe chemicals and evaluate if less hazardous \nchemicals can be used instead.\n“Product identifier” means the name or number \nused for a hazardous chemical on a label or in \nthe SDS. It provides a unique means by which \nthe user can identify the chemical. The product \nidentifier used shall permit cross-references to \nbe made among the list of hazardous chemicals \nrequired in the written hazard communication \nprogram, the label and the SDS.\nThe broadest possible perspective should \nbe taken when doing the survey. Sometimes \npeople think of “chemicals” as being only \nliquids in containers. The HCS covers \nchemicals in all forms—liquids, solids, gases, \nvapors, fumes, and mists—whether they are \n“contained” or not. The hazardous nature of \nthe chemical and the potential for exposure are \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration 12\nthe factors that determine whether a chemical \nis covered. If the chemical is not hazardous, it \nis not covered by the standard. If there is no \npotential for exposure (e.g., the chemical is \ninextricably bound and cannot be released), the \nchemical is not covered by the standard.\nLook around. Identify chemicals in containers, \nincluding pipes, but also think about chemicals \nthat are generated during work operations. For \nexample, welding fumes, dusts, and exhaust \nfumes are all sources of chemical exposures. \nRead the labels provided by suppliers for hazard \ninformation. Make a list of all chemicals in the \nworkplace that are potentially hazardous. For \nyour own information and planning, you may \nalso want to note on the list the location(s) of the \nproducts within the workplace, and an indication \nof the hazards as found on the label. This will \nhelp as you prepare the rest of your program.\nParagraph (b) of the standard, scope and \napplication, includes exemptions for various \nchemicals or workplace situations. After \ncompiling the complete list of chemicals, you \nshould review paragraph (b) to determine if \nany of the items can be eliminated from the \nlist because they are exempted materials. For \nexample, food, drugs, and cosmetics brought \ninto the workplace for personal consumption \nby workers are exempt. \nOnce you have compiled a complete list of \nthe potentially hazardous chemicals in the \nworkplace, the next step is to determine if \nyou have received SDSs for all of them. Check \nyour files against the inventory you have just \ncompiled. Employers are required to have \nSDSs for all hazardous chemicals that they \nuse. If any are missing, contact your supplier \nand request one. It is a good idea to document \nthese requests, either by keeping a copy of a \nletter or e-mail, or a note regarding telephone \nconversations. If you cannot show a good faith \neffort to receive the SDS, you can be cited for \nnot having the SDS for a hazardous chemical. \nIf you have SDSs for chemicals that are not on \nyour list, figure out why. Maybe you do not use \nthe chemical anymore. Or maybe you missed  it in your survey. Some suppliers provide \nSDSs for products that are not hazardous. \nThese SDSs do not have to be maintained.\nDo not allow workers to use any hazardous \nchemicals for which you have not received an \nSDS. The SDS provides information you need \nto ensure that proper protective measures are \nimplemented prior to worker exposure.\n ■Paragraph (e)(1)(ii): Methods to inform \nemployees of the hazards of non-routine tasks. \nThe written program needs to include how \nan employer will inform workers of hazards \nthat are outside of their normal work routine. \nWhile workers’ initial training will address the \ntypes of exposures they will encounter in their \nusual work routines, there may be other tasks \nto be performed on occasion that will expose \nthese workers to different hazards, as well as \nrequire novel control measures. For example, \nin a manufacturing facility, it may be necessary \nperiodically to drain and clean out reactor \nvessels. For this task, workers may be exposed \nto cleaning chemicals that are not normally in \nthe workplace, and the usual controls for the \nprocess may not protect them, so personal \nprotective equipment may have to be worn. \nThe written program needs to address how the \nemployer will handle such situations and make \nsure that workers involved have the necessary \ninformation to stay protected.\n ■Paragraph (e)(2): Multi-Employer Workplaces.  \nWhere there is more than one employer \noperating on a site, and employees may \nbe exposed to the chemicals used by each \nemployer, the employer’s written hazard \ncommunication program must address:\n —How on-site access to SDSs will be \nprovided to the other employer(s).\n —How such employers will be informed of \nneeded precautionary measures.\n —How such employers will be informed of \nthe on-site labeling system if it is different \nfrom the labels specified for shipped \ncontainers under the standard.\nHazard Communication: Small Entity Compliance Guide for Employers That Use Hazardous Chemicals 13\nIn summary, if you are not a new employer, \nyou should already have a written hazard \ncommunication program for your workplace. \nReview your written program to ensure that it is \nconsistent with the HazCom 2012 requirements. \nIt may need to be updated; for example, you may \nhave to add or delete chemicals from the list in \nthe program, or change your description of the \napproach to workplace labeling.\nIf your workers’ job assignment requires travel \nbetween various geographical locations, you \nmay keep the written program at the primary \nwork  location. \nMany trade associations and other professional \ngroups have provided sample programs and \nother assistance materials to employers. These \nhave been very helpful to many employers since \nthey tend to be tailored to the particular industry \ninvolved. You may wish to investigate whether your industry trade groups have developed such \nmaterials. Additionally, a sample written hazard \ncommunication program is included in Appendix A \nto this guide.\nAlthough such general guidance may be helpful, \nyou must remember that the written program has \nto reflect what you are doing in your workplace. \nTherefore, if you use a generic program it must \nbe adapted to address the facility that it actually \ncovers. For example, the written plan must list \nthe chemicals present at the site, indicate who is \nto be responsible for the various aspects of the \nprogram in your facility, and indicate where written \nmaterials will be made available to workers.\nIf OSHA inspects your workplace, the OSHA \nCompliance Safety and Health Officer (CSHO) will \nask to see your written plan. \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration 14\n3.   Ensure Containers \nare Labeled•\tKeep labels on shipped containers.\n•\tLabel workplace containers where required.\nLabels are the first part (paragraph (f) Labels and \nOther Forms of Warning)  of the three-part approach \nto communicating information downstream \nmentioned earlier. A label must be on the \nimmediate container of every hazardous chemical. \nThe label is an immediate type of warning since \nit is present in the work area, right on the actual \ncontainer of a hazardous chemical. It is a snapshot \nof the hazards and protective information related to \nthe chemical, and a summary of the more detailed \ninformation available on the SDS.\nWhen you purchase a hazardous chemical from a \nsupplier, you will receive a container that is labeled \nwith the information required under the HCS. \nEmployers can rely on the information provided \nby their suppliers. The label requirements in the \nHCS changed significantly with the publication of \nHazCom 2012. Under the prior standard, chemical \nmanufacturers and importers were required to \nconvey the hazards and identity of the products, \nbut were not given specifications on how this \nwas to be done. As a result, labels varied in \nterms of how the information was conveyed, the \nterminology used, and the design of the label. This \nmade it more difficult for employers and workers \nto access and comprehend the information \npresented than if chemical manufacturers and \nimporters follow the same approach.\nThe label requirements for the revised standard \nare more specific, which will lead to increased \nuniformity. This should benefit employers \nand workers by providing the information in \nstandardized language and graphics, making it \neasier to understand, and helping to ensure that \nlabels on containers of the same chemical from \ndifferent suppliers have the same information.\nHazCom 2012 provides chemical manufacturers \nand importers the information to be conveyed \nonce they have determined the hazard of a \nchemical. The labels you receive on a shipped container must have the following information, \nlocated together (other information may also \nappear on the label):\n ■Product identifier\n ■Signal word\n ■Hazard statement(s)\n ■Pictogram(s)\n ■Precautionary statement(s)\n ■Name, address, and phone number of the \nresponsible party\n ■The product identifier  is any chemical, \ncommon, or trade name or designation that the \nchemical manufacturer or importer chooses to \nuse on the label. The term must also appear on \nthe SDS. The signal word, hazard statement(s), \npictogram(s), and precautionary statement(s) \nare the label elements  that comprise the \nprimary information about hazards and \nprotective measures on the label.\n ■A signal word  is a word used to indicate the \nrelative level of severity of hazard and alert the \nreader to a potential hazard on the label. The \nsignal words used in the standard are “danger”  \nand “warning.”  “Danger” is used for the more \nsevere hazards, while “warning” is used for \nthe less severe hazards. Signal words were not \npreviously used in the HCS, although they do \noften appear on consumer labels. It is important \nto be aware of—and train workers on—the way \nsignal words convey a difference in the severity \nof the hazard. While the product is hazardous \nwherever a signal word is indicated, the signal \nword chosen can give a preliminary idea of the \nrelative significance of the effect.\n ■A hazard statement  is a statement assigned to \na hazard class and category that describes the \nnature of the hazard(s) of a chemical, including, \nwhere appropriate, the degree of hazard. \nExample: Fatal if swallowed.\nHazard Communication: Small Entity Compliance Guide for Employers That Use Hazardous Chemicals 15\n ■The hazard statement(s) for a hazardous \nchemical describe the hazard(s) in text, in \na simple, direct manner. There is a hazard \nstatement for each hazard category of a hazard \nclass, and it will vary depending on the degree \nof hazard. The example presented above is a \nhazard statement for acute oral toxicity. The \nhazard statement conveys that the chemical is \nseverely toxic, and ingestion of the chemical \nresults in death. But for less toxic chemicals, \nthe hazard statement may be “toxic if \nswallowed” or “harmful if swallowed.”  As with \nthe signal words, this information conveys the \nrelative severity of the hazard, which impacts \nhow it is handled and controlled.\n ■A pictogram  is a composition that may include \na symbol plus other graphic elements, such as \na border, background pattern, or color, that is \nintended to convey specific information about \nthe hazards of a chemical. Eight pictograms are \ndesignated under this standard for application \nto a hazard category. Under HazCom 2012, \npictograms are black symbols, on a white \nbackground, with a red diamond border. For \nexample, this is the pictogram for oxidizers:\nPictograms are an important addition to the \nhazard communication tools in the standard. \nA pictogram draws the attention of a label \nreader, and you and your workers should be \naware that the appearance of a pictogram in \na red diamond frame means that a hazard of \nconcern is present in the product. Some of the \npictograms in the standard have symbols that \nresemble the hazardous effect, and others are \nmerely meant to attract attention. Pictograms \nmay be used for several different hazardous \neffects as well (see Figure 3).Pictograms have long been used internationally \nbecause they convey information without text. \nThis allows users who are either literate in a \ndifferent language than that used on the label \nor who are not literate at all to understand that \nthe chemical is hazardous. \nOne of the systems that has long used \npictograms is the international transport \nsystem. This system has been adopted by \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), \nand is familiar to those who handle shipping \ncontainers in the United States. The symbols \nhave been harmonized as much as possible \nfor the hazards covered both in transport \nand in the workplace. While both pictograms \nare diamond-shaped, the transport system’s \npictograms have backgrounds of various \ncolors. Where the shipping container is also the \ncontainer used in the workplace, workers must \nbe made aware of the DOT pictograms1, as \nthey may appear on the label in addition to, or \ninstead of, the HazCom 2012 pictograms used \nto represent the same hazard. See Figure 4 for \nexamples of DOT pictograms. Note that the \nenvironment pictogram located in the center \nof the bottom row in Figure 3 is not required \nunder the OSHA standard since OSHA does \nnot regulate environmental hazards. However, \nyou may see this pictogram used on labels and \nSDSs to convey environmental hazards, and \nthat will provide useful information for you to \nuse in managing your chemicals.\n1. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) uses the terms transport \n“placards” or “labels” to refer to the diamond-shaped (square on point) \ngraphic elements that are used to identify shipments of hazardous materi -\nals. However, for the purpose of this document, these graphic elements \nare referred to as “pictograms.” More information on DOT placards or \nlabels may be found at www.dot.gov .\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration 16\nFigure 3: HazCom 2012 Pictograms\nHazard Communication: Small Entity Compliance Guide for Employers That Use Hazardous Chemicals 17\nFigure 4: Examples of Transport Pictograms\n\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration 18\n ■A precautionary statement  is a phrase that \ndescribes recommended measures that should \nbe taken to minimize or prevent adverse \neffects resulting from exposure to a hazardous \nchemical, or improper storage or handling. \nExample: Do not eat, drink, or smoke when \nusing this product.\nPrecautionary statements are key to helping you \ndecide what you need to do to protect workers \nand your workplace. There are four types of \nstatements: Prevention, Response, Storage, and \nDisposal.  These have been assigned to hazard \nclasses and categories.\nTherefore, a compliant HazCom 2012 label on a \nshipped container will have at least the following \ninformation as shown in Figure 5 (supplemental \ninformation is permitted as long as it does not \nconflict with the required information).\nYou are required by paragraph (f)(6) of the \nstandard to ensure that containers of hazardous \nchemicals in your workplace are labeled. For those \ncontainers that are received already labeled from the supplier, and are used in the workplace, simply \nmaintaining the label received from the supplier is \nthe best and easiest option. However, the standard \nis flexible, and employers may relabel these \ncontainers, or label other containers used in the \nworkplace with various options as long as workers \nhave immediate access to the specific information \nabout the physical and health hazards of the \nchemical. This could be included in the workplace \nhazard communication program. \nUnder paragraph (f)(7), employers may use signs, \nplacards, process sheets, batch tickets, operating \nprocedures, or other written material instead of \naffixing labels to individual stationary process \ncontainers, as long as the alternative method \nidentifies which containers it applies to and conveys \nat least general information regarding the hazards \nof the chemicals. Paragraph (f)(8) of the standard \nalso addresses portable containers into which the \nhazardous chemicals are transferred from a labeled \ncontainer, and which are for the immediate use of \nthe employee who performs the transfer. These \nportable containers do not have to be labeled.\nFigure 5: Example of Required HCS Label Elements\nProduct Identifier\nPictogram (Symbol in Red Frame)\nSignal Word (Danger)\nHazard Statement(s) (Extremely flammable gas)\nPrecautionary Statement(s) (Keep away from heat and open flames. No smoking. \nLeaking gas fire: Do not extinguish, unless leak can be stopped safely. Eliminate all ignition \nsources if safe to do so. Store in well-ventilated place.)\nName, Address, and Telephone Number\nof Manufacturer,  Importer,  or Other Responsible Party\nHazard Communication: Small Entity Compliance Guide for Employers That Use Hazardous Chemicals 19\nSome employers use third-party workplace label \nsystems, such as those that have numerical \nratings to indicate the hazards (e.g., National \nFire Protection Association (NFPA) or Hazardous \nMaterials Identification System (HMIS)). These \nmay be used in conjunction with the supplemental \ninformation on the label to ensure that workers \nhave complete information, as long as the ratings \nare consistent with the hazard definitions in \nHazCom 2012, i.e., the criteria used to assign the \nnumerical ratings reflects the hazard categories \nin each hazard class in HazCom 2012. One note \nwith regard to numerical ratings—these systems \ngenerally use the number 1 to indicate the lowest \ndegree of hazard, and the number 4 as the highest \ndegree. This is the opposite of the hazard category \nnumbering in HazCom 2012. Therefore, if as an \nemployer you are preparing such labels based \non information on the SDS, you must ensure that \nthe numbers are properly applied to reflect the \naccurate degree of hazard information. Category \nnumbers do not appear on HazCom 2012 shipped \ncontainer labels, and are not equivalent to the \nhazard rating systems. \nHazCom 2012 hazard category numbers are not \nrequired to appear on shipped container labels, and \nare not equivalent to the NFPA and HMIS hazard \nrating systems. The employer must make sure that labels in the \nworkplace are legible and prominently displayed. \nWhile the label information must be in English, \nemployers are free to add warnings in other \nlanguages if workers would find that helpful. OSHA \nhas prepared  QuickCards™ to describe the label \nelements ( OSHA 3492 ), as well as illustrate the \npictograms ( OSHA 3491 ). These are available on \nthe OSHA web page, or can be obtained from your \nlocal OSHA area office.\nIf your workplace is inspected by OSHA, CSHOs \nwill be looking for at least the following aspects of \nyour labeling approach:\n1. Designation of person(s) responsible for \nensuring compliant labeling of shipped and in-\nplant containers;\n2. Description of written alternatives to labeling of \nstationary process containers (if used); \n3. Appropriate labels on all workplace containers, \nincluding those received from a supplier, \nsecondary containers,  and stationary process \ncontainers; \n4. A description and explanation of labels on both \nshipped and workplace containers included in \nthe employee training program; and,\n5. Procedures to review and update workplace \nlabel information when necessary.\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration 20\n4.   Maintain Safety \nData Sheets•\tMaintain safety data sheets for each hazardous chemical in \nthe workplace.\n•\tEnsure that safety data sheets are readily accessible \nto employees.\nThe second part in the approach to communicating \ninformation in HazCom 2012 is to maintain \nSDSs ( paragraph (g) Safety Data Sheets and \nMandatory Appendix D ). The SDSs are the source \nof detailed information on hazardous chemicals. \nThis includes information for many different \naudiences—employers, workers, safety and \nhealth professionals, emergency responders, \ngovernment agencies, and consumers. It is difficult \nfor one document to serve the needs of all of these \ndifferent audiences since some require much \nmore technical information than others. Therefore, \nthe SDS sections have generally been organized \nso that the information of most use to exposed \nworkers, emergency responders, and others who \ndo not need extensive technical detail is in the \nbeginning of the SDS, while the more technical \ninformation most commonly read by health and \nsafety professionals is located in the later sections. \nFor example, a description of a chemical’s health \neffects appears in Section 2, hazard identification, \nbut the toxicological data upon which the \ndetermination of these effects is based appears \nin Section 11, toxicological information. All of the \nsections are available to any reader, but there \nis a difference between what is necessary for \na broader audience (workers and emergency \nresponders, for example), and what might be \nneeded by others designing protective measures \nor providing medical services. \nThe SDS requirements in HazCom 2012 are based \non an internationally agreed upon 16-section SDS. \nThis format is based on ANSI Z400.12, so it \n2 The first American National Standard Institute (ANSI) standard developed \nto assist in the preparation of safety data sheets ( American National \nStandard for Hazardous Industrial Chemicals–Material Safety Data Sheets–\nPreparation) was issued in 1993.  This standard was updated in 1998 and \n2004. In 2010, it was combined with ANSI Z129 and renamed, American \nNational Standard for Hazardous Workplace Chemicals–Hazard Evaluation \nand Safety Data Sheet and Precautionary Labeling Preparation.is most likely already familiar to your employees. \nHazCom 2012 establishes section headings for the \nSDS, as well as the order in which they are to be \nprovided, and the minimum information required \nto be included in each section under Appendix D \nof the standard. However, the information in some \nof the sections are non-mandatory because they \naddress information that involve the requirements \nof other government bodies, and thus are not \nunder OSHA’s jurisdiction. Even though these \nsections are not considered mandatory by OSHA, \nthe headings are still required to be present on the \nSDS. They will provide useful information for you \nto address other requirements you may need to \nfollow. The sixteen sections are as follows, with \nthe non-mandatory sections indicated in italics:\n1. Identification\n2. Hazard(s) identification\n3. Composition/information on ingredients\n4. First-aid measures\n5. Firefighting measures\n6. Accidental release measures\n7. Handling and storage\n8. Exposure control/personal protection\n9. Physical and chemical properties\n10. Stability and reactivity\n11. Toxicological information\n12. Ecological information\n13. Disposal considerations\n14. Transport information\n15. Regulatory information\n16. Other information \nChemical manufacturers and importers are \nrequired to obtain or develop an SDS for each \nhazardous chemical they produce or import. \nChemical manufacturers, importers, and \nHazard Communication: Small Entity Compliance Guide for Employers That Use Hazardous Chemicals 21\ndistributors are responsible for ensuring that their \ncustomers are provided a copy of these SDSs, at \nthe time of the first shipment, and when an SDS \nis updated with new and significant information. \nEmployers must have an SDS for each hazardous \nchemical which they use. Employers may rely \non the information received from their suppliers \nunless they know the information is incorrect. \nIf you do not receive an SDS automatically, you \nmust request one as soon as possible. If you \nreceive an SDS that is obviously inadequate, with, \nfor example, blank spaces, you must request an \nappropriately completed one. If your request for \nan SDS or for a corrected SDS does not produce \nthe information needed, you should contact your \nlocal OSHA area office for assistance in obtaining \nthe SDS. Employers must maintain the current \nversion of the SDS; if a new SDS is received with a \nshipment, they must maintain and make available \nthe new SDS.\nThe SDSs must be in English. Many larger \nmanufacturers also produce SDSs in other \nlanguages. If you have workers who speak \nlanguage(s) other than English, you may be able to \nobtain SDSs in those languages to ensure effective \nhazard communication.\nEmployers must maintain copies of SDSs in their \nworkplaces, and must ensure that SDSs are readily \naccessible to workers when they are in their work \nareas during their work shifts. This accessibility \nmay be accomplished in many different ways. You \nmust decide what is appropriate for your particular \nworkplace. Some employers keep the SDSs in \na binder in a central location (e.g., in a pick-up \ntruck on a construction site). Others, particularly \nin workplaces with large numbers of chemicals, \nprovide access electronically. However, if access \nto SDSs is provided electronically, there must \nbe an adequate back-up system in place in the \nevent of a power outage, equipment failure, or \nother emergency involving the primary electronic \nsystem. As long as workers can get the information \nwhen they need it, any approach may be used. \nWhen workers must travel between workplaces \nduring a work shift, SDSs may be kept at the \nprimary workplace facility. No matter what system is used, employers must ensure that workers and \nmedical personnel can immediately obtain the \nrequired information in an emergency.\nIn order to ensure that you have a current SDS for \neach chemical in the plant as required, and that \nworker access is provided, OSHA’s CSHOs will be \nlooking for the following items in your program:\n1. Designation of person(s) responsible for \nobtaining and maintaining the SDSs;\n2. How such sheets are maintained in the \nworkplace (e.g., in notebooks in the work \narea(s) or electronically), and how workers \nobtain access to them when they are in their \nwork area during the work shift;\n3. Procedures to follow when the SDS is not \nreceived at the time of the first shipment;\n4. An SDS for each hazardous chemical in \nthe workplace, and training of workers that \nincludes review of SDS format and use.\nFor employers using hazardous chemicals, an \nimportant aspect of the hazard communication \nprogram is to ensure that someone is responsible \nfor obtaining and maintaining the SDSs for \nevery hazardous chemical in the workplace. To \nensure that your hazard communication program \nimproves safety and health with regard to \nchemical use, you should review the SDSs, and use \nthe information to choose the needed protective \nmeasures to prevent or reduce exposures in your \nworkplace. SDSs should be used to evaluate your \nworkplace, and establish a plan to ensure it is safe. \nThe following is a section-by-section description of \nthe information required for each part of the SDS \nfrom Appendix D of HazCom 2012. Become familiar \nwith the information available in each section of an \nSDS so that you will be able to more quickly access \nthis information in an emergency and make better \nuse of the data available.\nOSHA has developed a QuickCard™ on SDSs \n(OSHA 3493 ) that may be useful in your training \nprogram.

Inform and Train \nEmployees•\tTrain employees on the hazardous chemicals in their \nwork area before initial assignment, and when new hazards \nare introduced.\n•\tInclude the requirements of the standard, hazards of \nchemicals, appropriate protective measures, and where and \nhow to obtain additional information.\nThe third part of the hazard communication approach \nin HazCom 2012 is employee information and training \n(paragraph (h) Employee Information and Training) . \nThe key requirement is in paragraph (h)(1):\n(h)(1) Employers shall provide employees with \neffective information and training on hazardous \nchemicals in their work area at the time of their \ninitial assignment, and whenever a new chemical \nhazard the employees have not previously been \ntrained about is introduced into their work area. \nInformation and training may be designed to \ncover categories of hazards (e.g., flammability, \ncarcinogenicity) or specific chemicals. Chemical-\nspecific information must always be available \nthrough labels and safety data sheets.\nFor information and training to be effective, the \nworkers in the training must comprehend the \nhazards in the workplace and ways to protect \nthemselves. OSHA does not expect that workers \nwill be able to recall and recite all data provided \nabout each hazardous chemical in the workplace. \nWhat is most important is that workers understand \nthat they are exposed to hazardous chemicals, \nknow how to read labels and SDSs, and have a \ngeneral understanding of what information is \nprovided in these documents, and how to access \nthese tools. Workers must also be aware of the \nprotective measures available in their workplace, \nhow to use or implement these measures, and who \nthey should contact if an issue arises. \nInformation and training may be done either by \nindividual chemical, or by hazard classes and \ncategories (such as acute toxicity or flammable \nliquids). If there are only a few chemicals in the \nworkplace, then you may want to discuss each \none individually. Where there are large numbers of chemicals, or the chemicals change frequently, you \nwill probably want to train generally based on the \nhazard classes and categories. Workers must have \naccess to the substance-specific information on \nthe labels and SDSs.\nHazCom 2012 requires employers to both provide \ncertain information to employees and to train \nemployees. The standard requires employees to be \ninformed of:\n ■The general requirements of the Hazard \nCommunication Standard;\n ■Where hazardous chemicals are located in their \nwork areas (operations where exposure may \noccur); and,\n ■What the workplace hazard communication \nprogram includes, and where and how they can \naccess the program.\nTraining, on the other hand, is a more active \nprocess. The training conducted to comply with \nHazCom 2012 must address the following:\n ■Methods and observations that may be used to \ndetect the presence or release of a hazardous \nchemical in the work area (such as monitoring \nconducted by the employer, continuous \nmonitoring devices, visual appearance or odor of \nhazardous chemicals when being released, etc.);\n ■The physical, health, simple asphyxiation, \ncombustible dust and pyrophoric gas hazards, \nas well as hazards not otherwise classified, of \nthe chemicals in the work area;\n ■The measures employees can take to protect \nthemselves from these hazards, including \nspecific procedures the employer has \nimplemented to protect employees from  \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration 26\nexposure to hazardous chemicals, such \nas appropriate work practices, emergency \nprocedures, and personal protective equipment \nto be used; and,\n ■The details of the hazard communication \nprogram developed by the employer, including \nan explanation of the labels received on \nshipped containers and the workplace labeling \nsystem used by their employer; the SDS, \nincluding the format of the SDS (where each \ntype of information is located) and how \nemployees can obtain and use the appropriate \nhazard information.\nA properly conducted training program will ensure \nworker comprehension and understanding. It is \nnot sufficient to either just read material to the \nworkers, or simply hand them material to read. \nAs explained in Dr. Michaels’ OSHA Training \nStandards Policy Statement  (April 28, 2010) , OSHA \nrequires employers to present information in a \nmanner and language that their employees can \nunderstand. If employers customarily need to \ncommunicate work instructions or other workplace \ninformation to employees in a language other than \nEnglish, they will also need to provide safety and \nhealth training to employees in the same manner. \nSimilarly, if the employee’s vocabulary is limited, \nthe training must account for that limitation. By the \nsame token, if employees are not literate, telling \nthem to read training materials will not satisfy the \nemployer’s training obligation. \nIn conducting a training program, you want to \ncreate a climate where workers feel free to ask \nquestions. This will help you to ensure that the \ninformation is understood. You must always \nremember that the underlying purpose of the \nHCS is to reduce the incidence of chemical source \nillnesses and injuries. This will be accomplished by \nmodifying behavior through the provision of hazard \ninformation and information about protective \nmeasures. If your program works, you and your \nworkers will better understand the chemical hazards \nin the workplace, and how to protect workers from \nexperiencing adverse effects. The procedures \nyou establish regarding, for example, purchasing, \nstoring, and handling of these chemicals will \nimprove, and thereby reduce the risks posed to \nworkers exposed to the chemical hazards involved. Furthermore, your workers’ comprehension will \nalso be increased, and proper work practices will be \nmore likely followed in your workplace.\nIf you are going to do the training yourself, you \nwill have to understand the material and be \nprepared to motivate the workers to learn. This is \nnot always an easy task, but the benefits are worth \nthe effort. More information regarding appropriate \ntraining can be found in Appendix B of this guide, \nwhich provides steps to follow in setting up and \nconducting training.\nIn reviewing your hazard communication program \nwith regard to information and training, the \nfollowing items need to be considered:\n1. Designation of person(s) responsible for \nconducting training;\n2. Format of the program to be used \n(audiovisuals, classroom instruction, etc.);\n3. Elements of the information and training \nprogram (should be consistent with the \nelements in paragraph (h) of the standard); and, \n4. Procedure to train new workers at the time \nof their initial assignment to work with a \nhazardous chemical, and to train workers \nwhen a new chemical hazard is introduced \ninto the workplace.\nThe written program should provide enough \ndetails about the employer’s plans in this \narea to assess whether or not a good faith \neffort is being made to train workers. When \nassessing an employer’s compliance with hazard \ncommunication training requirements, OSHA \nCSHOs will talk to workers to determine if they \nhave received training, if they know they are \nexposed to hazardous chemicals, and if they know \nwhere to obtain substance-specific information \non labels and SDSs. It should be noted that if \nworkers do not speak English, the employer must \nconvey the hazard communication information \nin the language they understand—just like other \njob requirements and instructions are provided. \nOSHA has bilingual CSHOs, and they will be \nspeaking to workers who speak another language \nto determine compliance.\nHazard Communication: Small Entity Compliance Guide for Employers That Use Hazardous Chemicals 27\nThe standard does not require employers to \nmaintain records of employee training, but many \nemployers choose to do so. This may help you \nmonitor your own program to ensure that all \nworkers are appropriately trained. Keeping records \nthat document who was trained, when the training \nwas conducted, and what was covered is also \nhelpful to document compliance with OSHA’s \ntraining requirement in case of an inspection. The \nstandard does not require retraining on a regular \nschedule, it simply requires retraining if there is \na new chemical hazard introduced into the work \narea. If your initial training program includes all \npotential hazards covered by HazCom 2012, there \nis no retraining required. However, it is good \nbusiness practice to repeat and reinforce what is \nlearned in training to make sure that workers retain \nthe hazard information. \nIf you already have a hazard communication \ntraining program, you may simply have to update \nit to comply with HazCom 2012. In particular, by \nDecember 1, 2013, you will need to train your \nemployees about the new label and SDS formats \nthey will be seeing in their work areas. Additional \nhazard training is not required if you have already \ntrained under the existing hazard communication \nrequirements. However, after you receive all of \nthe new labels and SDSs, and have updated your \nhazard communication program, you may find that there is a type of hazard on which employees have \nnot yet received training. You will need to train \nemployees on these new hazards at the time you \nbecome aware of the new hazard. If you become \naware of new hazards after December 1, 2015, you \nwill have until June 1, 2016 to ensure those hazards \nare included in the hazard communication program, \nthe workplace labeling reflects these new hazards, \nand employees are trained on these new hazards.\nAn employer can provide employees information \nand training through whatever means are found \nappropriate. Although there will always have to be \nsome training onsite (such as informing workers of \nthe location and availability of the written program \nand SDSs), employee training may be satisfied in \npart by general training about the requirements \nof the HCS and about chemical hazards on the \njob which is provided by, for example, trade \nassociations, unions, colleges, and professional \nschools. In addition, previous training, education \nand experience of a worker may relieve the \nemployer of some of the burdens of informing and \ntraining that worker. Regardless of the method \nrelied upon, however, the employer is always \nultimately responsible for ensuring that workers \nare adequately trained. If the CSHO finds that the \ntraining is deficient, the employer will be cited for \nthe deficiency regardless of who actually provided \nthe training on behalf of the employer.\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration 28\n6.   Evaluate and \nReassess Your \nProgram•\tReview your hazard communication program periodically to \nmake sure that it is still working and meeting its objectives.\n•\tRevise your program as appropriate to address changed \nconditions in the workplace (e.g., new chemicals, new \nhazards, etc.).\nBecause your hazard communication program \nmust remain up to date, it will be necessary to \nperiodically evaluate and reassess your program.\nThe information in your written program must be \naccurate. The list of hazardous chemicals required \nto be maintained as part of the written program \nwill serve as an inventory. As new chemicals are \npurchased, the list must be updated. Revisions to \nthe inventory of chemicals should be made when \nyou eliminate chemicals in the workplace, or when \nyou bring in a new chemical. The inventory also \ncan be used to ensure that you have SDSs for all \nchemicals in the workplace, and such revisions \nare key to ensuring that is achieved. In addition, \ndesignation of people to handle different parts of \nthe program should also be current and accurate. \nMany companies have found it convenient to \ninclude on their purchase orders the name and \naddress of the person designated in their company \nto receive SDSs to help maintain a complete set.\nProgram coordinators should routinely walk around \nthe workplace to check that containers are labeled as \nrequired and that workers are following established \nwork practices to protect themselves from chemical \nexposure. Proactive monitoring of the workplace is \ncritical to ensuring compliance with the HCS.As new SDSs are received, there should be a \nprocess in place to review them and determine \nwhether any handling procedures need to change \nto protect against the hazards of these chemicals. \nUsing information on the SDS effectively will make \nsafer workplace conditions a standard business \npractice in your facility. \nThis simple checklist will help to ensure that you \nare in compliance with the standard:\nObtained/accessed a copy of the standard. ____\nRead and understood the requirements. ____\nAssigned responsibility for tasks. ____\nPrepared an inventory of chemicals. ____\nEnsured that containers are labeled. ____\nObtained SDSs for each chemical. ____\nPrepared written program. ____\nMade SDSs available to workers. ____\nConducted training for workers. ____\nEstablished procedures to maintain \ncurrent  program.____\nEstablished procedures to evaluate \nprogram  effectiveness, including \nmaintenance of SDSs. \n \n____\nHazard Communication: Small Entity Compliance Guide for Employers That Use Hazardous Chemicals 29\nIII.  CONCLUSION\nOSHA believes that the Hazard Communication \nStandard is of critical importance to ensuring that \nhazardous chemicals are identified, and that proper \nmeasures are implemented in workplaces to \nachieve safe use and handling. By understanding \nthe hazards of the chemicals, and using available \ninformation to pick the proper control measures to address these hazards, employers can achieve \nmany benefits for themselves, as well as for their \nexposed workers. HazCom 2012 provides the \nframework for building a chemical safety and \nhealth management program in a workplace. \nFigure 6 illustrates the steps that have been \ndiscussed to ensure that a workplace hazard \ncommunication program is effective. \nFigure 6:  An Effective Hazard Communication Program\n  Eﬀec/g415v e Hazard \nCommunica /g415on \nProgram Read and Understand  \nthe Standard; Assign  \nResponsibili/g415es  for \nTasks \nPrepare and \nImplement a Wri/g425en \nHazard  \nCommuni ca/g415on \nProgram with \nChemical  List \nEnsure  All Containers \nare Labe led \nMaintain Safet y Data  \nSheets for All \nHazardous Chemicals \nand Make Accessible  \nto Employees  Inform and Train \nEmployees About the \nHCS,  Workp lace \nHazards,  and \nProtec/g415ve Measures  Estab lish Procedures  \nto Update When \nNecessary; E valuat e \nEﬀec/g415veness; Use \nInforma/g415on to  Select \nand Maintain  Needed \nProtec/g415ve Measures  \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration 30\nAPPENDIX A:  \nSAMPLE WRITTEN HAZARD \nCOMMUNICATION PROGRAM\nThe following sample hazard communication \nprogram is based on the requirements of the \nHazard Communication Standard (HazCom 2012), \n29 CFR 1910.1200.

However, if you use this or any \nother sample program, you must customize it to \nyour specific workplace, otherwise you will not be \nin compliance with the HCS. \nHAZARD COMMUNICATION PROGRAM\n1. Company Policy\nTo ensure that information about the dangers of all \nhazardous chemicals used by ( Name of Company ) \nis known by all affected workers, the following \nhazard communication program has been \nimplemented. Under this program, workers will be \ninformed of the requirements of the OSHA Hazard \nCommunication Standard, the operations where \nexposure to hazardous chemicals may occur, and \nhow workers can access this program, as well as \nlabels and SDSs.\nThis program applies to any chemical which is \nknown to be present in the workplace in such \na manner that workers may be exposed under \nnormal conditions of use or in a foreseeable \nemergency. All work areas that involve potential \nexposure to chemicals are part of the hazard \ncommunication program. Copies of the hazard \ncommunication program are available in the \n(location ) for review by any interested worker.\n(Name of responsible person and/or position ) is the \nprogram coordinator, with overall responsibility for \nthe program, including reviewing and updating this \nplan as necessary.2. Container Labeling\n(Name of responsible person and/or position ) will \nverify that all containers received for use will be \nclearly labeled in accord with the requirements \nof HazCom 2012, including a product identifier, \npictogram, hazard statement, signal word, and \nprecautionary statements, as well as the supplier’s \ncontact information (name and address).\nThe ( name of responsible person and/or position ) \nin each work area will ensure that all secondary \ncontainers are labeled with the original supplier’s \nlabel or with an alternative workplace label. For \nhelp with labeling, see ( name of responsible \nperson and/or position ).\nOn the following individual stationary process \ncontainers, we are using ( description of labeling \nsystem used ) rather than a label to convey the \nrequired information:\n(List containers here )\nWe are using an in-house labeling system \n(describe any in-house system which conveys \nrequired workplace label information ).\nThe ( name of responsible person and/or position ) \nwill review the company labeling procedures every \n(provide a time period) and will update labels as \nrequired.\n3. Safety Data Sheets (SDSs)\nThe ( name of responsible person and/or position ) \nis responsible for establishing and monitoring the \ncompany SDS program. The procedure below will \nbe followed when an SDS is not received at the \ntime of initial shipment:\n(Describe procedure to be followed here )\nCopies of SDSs for all hazardous chemicals to \nwhich workers are exposed or are potentially \nexposed will be kept in (identify location). Workers \ncan access SDSs by (insert procedure for access).\nNote: If alternatives to paper copies of SDSs are \nused, describe the format used and how workers \ncan access the SDSs.\nHazard Communication: Small Entity Compliance Guide for Employers That Use Hazardous Chemicals 31\nSDSs will be readily available to all workers in each \nwork area during each work shift. If an SDS is not \navailable, contact ( name of responsible person and/\nor position ).\nWhen revised SDSs are received, the following \nprocedures will be followed to replace old SDSs:\n(Describe procedures )\nThe ( name of responsible person and/or position ) \nis responsible for reviewing the SDSs received for \nsafety and health implications, and initiating any \nneeded changes in workplace practices.\n4. Employee Information and Training\n(Name of responsible person and/or position ) is \nresponsible for employee information and training.\nEvery worker who will be potentially exposed to \nhazardous chemicals will receive initial training \non the Hazard Communication standard and this \nprogram before starting work. \nThe training program for new workers is as follows \n(describe how the training will be presented, and \nwhat it will include ).\nPrior to introducing a new chemical hazard into \nany work area, each worker in that work area will \nbe given information and training as outlined \nabove for the new chemical hazard. The training \nformat will be as follows:\n(Describe training format, such as audiovisuals, \ninteractive computer programs, classroom \ninstruction, etc. )\n5. Hazards of Non-routine Tasks\nPeriodically, workers are required to perform \nnon-routine tasks that are hazardous. Examples \nof non-routine tasks are: confined space entry, \ntank cleaning, and painting reactor vessels. Prior \nto starting work on such projects, each affected \nworker will be given information by ( Name of \nresponsible person and/or position ) about the \nhazardous chemicals he or she may encounter \nduring such activity. This information will include \nspecific chemical hazards, protective and safety \nmeasures the worker should use, and steps the company is taking to reduce the hazards, \nincluding ventilation, respirators, the presence of \nanother worker (buddy systems), and emergency \nprocedures.\n6. Informing Other Employers/Contractors\nIt is the responsibility of ( Name of responsible \nperson and/or position ) to provide other employers \nand contractors with information about hazardous \nchemicals that their workers may be exposed \nto on this work site, and suggested precautions \nfor workers. It is the responsibility of ( Name of \nresponsible person and/or position ) to obtain \ninformation about hazardous chemicals used by \nother employers to which our workers may be \nexposed.\nOther employers and contractors will be provided \nwith SDSs for hazardous chemicals generated by \nthis company’s operations in the following manner:\n(Describe company policy here)\nIn addition to providing a copy of an SDS to other \nemployers, other employers will be informed of \nnecessary precautionary measures to protect \nworkers exposed to operations performed by this \ncompany.\nAlso, other employers will be informed of the hazard \nlabels used by the company. If alternative workplace \nlabeling systems are used, the other employers will \nbe provided with information to understand the \nlabels used for hazardous chemicals to which their \nworkers may have exposure.\n7. List of Hazardous Chemicals\nA list of all known hazardous chemicals in the \nworkplace is attached to this program. This list \nincludes the name of each chemical, and the \nwork area(s) in which each of the chemicals is \nused. Further information on each chemical may \nbe obtained from the SDSs, located in ( identify \nlocation ).\nWhen new chemicals are received, this list is \nupdated within (x) days of introduction into the \nworkplace. To ensure that any new chemical \nis added in a timely manner, the following \nprocedures shall be followed:\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration 32\n(Identify procedures to be followed)\nThe hazardous chemical inventory is compiled and \nmaintained by ( Name of responsible person and/\nor position and telephone number ).\n8. Chemicals in Unlabeled Pipes\nWork activities may be performed by workers in \nareas where chemicals are transferred through \nunlabeled pipes. Prior to starting work in these areas, the worker shall be informed by (Name \nof responsible person and/or position)  about \nthe identity and hazards of the chemicals in the \npipe, as well as required precautionary measures \nrequired to be followed. \n9. Program Availability\nA copy of this program will be made available, \nupon request, to workers, their designated \nrepresentatives, and OSHA.\nHazard Communication: Small Entity Compliance Guide for Employers That Use Hazardous Chemicals 33\nAPPENDIX B:  \nQUICK GUIDE TO HAZARD \nCOMMUNICATION TRAINING\nThe Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) (29 \nCFR 1910.1200) requires employers that have \nhazardous chemicals in their workplaces to \nimplement a hazard communication program. \nThe program includes information about labels on \ncontainers, safety data sheets (SDSs), and training \nfor workers. Each employer must describe in a \nwritten program how it will meet the requirements \nof the HCS in each of these areas.\nFor employers that use chemicals, rather than \nproduce them, labels and SDSs are received \nwith the products they purchase. These written \ndocuments form the basis of the hazard \ncommunication program, providing information \nfor both employers and workers about the hazards \nof the chemicals, as well as ways to protect people \nfrom experiencing adverse effects as a result of \ntheir use. Training is the last step to be undertaken \nto implement an effective hazard communication \nprogram. Through proper training, the employer \nhas the opportunity to ensure that workers \nunderstand the hazards of the chemicals they work with, as well as what steps to take to ensure that \nthey are protected from them. It also introduces \nthem to labels and SDSs, explaining how to \naccess these documents in their own workplace \nto obtain additional information. Training is \ntherefore a critical part of the approach to hazard \ncommunication, tying together the three major \ncomponents in an understandable form.\nBefore providing training, the employer should \nhave a basic understanding of the requirements \nof the HCS, and have prepared its hazard \ncommunication program. This quick guide will \nfocus on what is needed to set up a hazard \ncommunication training program. It is based on \nTraining Requirements in OSHA Standards and \nTraining Guidelines  (OSHA 2254 ) developed by \nOSHA to assist employers to design any type of \noccupational safety and health training program, \nbut relates the Guidelines specifically to hazard \ncommunication. It is a step-by-step approach. \nOSHA has also developed a series of QuickCards™ \non elements of the training that employers \nmay find useful: www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/\nghsquickcards.html .\nTraining Step Factors to Consider\nDetermining \nif training is \nneededAre workers potentially exposed to hazardous chemicals in your workplace?  You can determine \nthis by reviewing the labels received on containers of chemicals you use, as well as safety data \nsheets (SDSs). You must have a hazard communication program if you have workers who are \npotentially exposed to hazardous chemicals. Training workers is part of the required hazard \ncommunication program. Therefore, training is needed wherever workers are potentially \nexposed to hazardous chemicals in their workplaces.\nIdentifying \ntraining needsWorkers must be trained before they are initially assigned to work where they are potentially \nexposed to a hazardous chemical. Therefore, if you have never provided training before, you \nmust train all workers who are potentially exposed. Once this initial training is completed, you \nmust train any new workers who are hired and will be working with hazardous chemicals. You \nmust also provide training whenever a new hazard is introduced, or when workers change \njobs and therefore face potential exposures. While training is not required to be repeated on \na regular basis, you may want to consider doing that to be sure that workers remember what \nthey have learned. It is also a good opportunity for you to review your hazard communication \nprogram, and make sure that it is still working effectively.\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration 34\nTraining Step Factors to Consider\nIdentifying \ngoals and \nobjectivesCompliance with the requirements of the Hazard Communication Standard is a primary goal. \nCompliance will promote a safer workplace by ensuring that the potential hazards of chemicals \nare known both to you and to your workers. In addition, the measures to follow to prevent \nadverse health or physical effects resulting from chemical exposures should be familiar to \neveryone in the workplace. Preparing for the training gives you an opportunity to review the \nhazards of the chemicals you have in the workplace, and to consider substituting less hazardous \nchemicals where appropriate. It also allows you to review the protective measures you have \nin place to ensure that they are working, and to consider other types of protection as well. \nImplementation of a hazard communication program should be useful both to employers \nthat have hazardous chemicals as part of their workplace processes, and to workers who are \nexposed to those chemicals. Training ties together all of the aspects of the workplace hazard \ncommunication program to relate it to the actual workplace conditions. Thus both employers \nand workers should be more familiar with the hazards present, know what steps must be taken \nto control those hazards, and be assured that the workplace is safer. They should also know how \nto obtain more information when needed from the container labels and the SDSs.\nYou may want to consider if you have any additional learning objectives you would like to \naccomplish through this training program. For example, you may also have compliance \nobligations for related standards that could be combined into this program and accomplished \nin one training session (such as training required under the Respiratory Protection standard). \nAlso, it may be an opportunity to review safe work practices and ways to perform jobs in a more \nefficient manner, and tie this into avoiding chemical hazards.\nIdentifying \nlearning \nactivitiesThe Hazard Communication Standard specifies what information must be provided to workers:\n•\tThe requirements of the Hazard Communication Standard;\n•\tAny operations in their work area where hazardous chemicals are present; and\n•\tThe location and availability of the written hazard communication program, including the \nrequired list(s) of hazardous chemicals, and SDSs required by the standard.\nIn addition to providing this information to workers, they must be trained on the following:\n•\tMethods and observations that may be used to detect the presence or release of a \nhazardous chemical in the work area (such as monitoring conducted by the employer, \ncontinuous monitoring devices, visual appearance or odor of hazardous chemicals when \nbeing released, etc.);\n•\tThe physical and health hazards of the chemicals in the work area;\n•\tThe measures workers can take to protect themselves from these hazards, including specific \nprocedures the employer has implemented to protect workers from exposure to hazardous \nchemicals, such as appropriate work practices, emergency procedures, and personal \nprotective equipment to be used; and\n•\tThe details of the hazard communication program developed by the employer, including an \nexplanation of the labeling system and the SDS, and how workers can obtain and use the \nappropriate information.\nThe way in which this information is conveyed is left up to the trainer to determine. You can \nuse any type of media available to you (such as slides, videos, computer interactive programs). \nCombinations of media are often an effective way to keep the workers’ attention. In addition, \nactive participation is important, so you may want to include learning activities that allow the \nworkers to participate and have hands-on experiences. Relating the information to their specific \nworkplace conditions helps to ensure that you meet the requirements of the standard, as well as \nimproving learning and making the training more interesting.\nHazard Communication: Small Entity Compliance Guide for Employers That Use Hazardous Chemicals 35\nTraining Step Factors to Consider\nConducting the \ntrainingPreparation:   In order to train workers under the Hazard Communication Standard, the trainer \nmust be familiar with:  \n•\tthe requirements of the standard that apply to the workplace; \n•\tthe hazardous chemicals in the workplace to which workers are potentially exposed, as well \nas the types of hazards they pose; \n•\tthe hazard communication program implemented in the workplace; and \n•\tthe protective measures being employed in the workplace to prevent adverse effects from \noccurring.\nIn addition to being thoroughly familiar with the material to be covered in the training, the \ntrainer must be aware of the facilities available for the training, including the physical location, \nthe type of equipment  (e.g., a PowerPoint projector, computer), and plan the training session \naccordingly based on the conditions. \nPresenting the training:   The purpose of the training is to convey information that is important \nto the student, and will achieve a safer workplace. Care should be taken to ensure that the \nfacilities are conducive to a successful training session, and that the presentation is done in \na way that motivates learning and a positive outcome. Worker participation helps to ensure \nthat the learning objectives are accomplished. This can be done through hands-on examples, \ndiscussions, and other active means of conveying the required information.\nEvaluating \nprogram \neffectivenessConsideration should be given to including some sort of evaluation tool in the training to obtain \nfeedback from the workers on the presentation, what formats might work better, and what they \nlearned. This could be in the form of a sheet to be filled out by workers after the training. In \nevaluating the effectiveness of the program, you should observe how the training has changed \nworker behavior. For example, if workers have better compliance with use of protective measures \n(such as wearing gloves when appropriate), this could factor into the evaluation of the program.\nImproving the \ntrainingThe trainers should use their own impressions as well as feedback from the students to improve \nthe training before it is presented again. If workers are not interested in the training as it is \nconducted, do not appear motivated, and do not exhibit an increased knowledge of hazards and \nthe use of protective practices, it may be necessary to review and revise the training to achieve \na better outcome.\nFollowing these seven steps should enable you \nto design and implement an effective hazard \ncommunication training program. A safer workplace benefits the employer as well as the worker, and \ntheir shared interest in this goal should help to \nachieve effective hazard communication training.\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration 36\nWORKERS’ RIGHTS\nUnder OSHA law, workers are entitled to working \nconditions that do not pose a risk of serious harm. \nTo help assure a safe and healthful workplace, the \nlaw provides workers with the right to:\n ■File a confidential complaint with OSHA to have \ntheir workplace inspected.\n ■Receive information and training about \nhazards, methods to prevent harm, and the \nOSHA standards that apply to their workplace. \nThe training must be done in a language and \nvocabulary workers can understand.\n ■Receive copies of records of work-related injuries \nand illnesses that occur in their workplace.\n ■Receive copies of the results from tests and \nmonitoring done to find and measure hazards \nin their workplace. ■Receive copies of their workplace medical \nrecords.\n ■Participate in an OSHA inspection and speak in \nprivate with the inspector.\n ■File a complaint with OSHA if they have been \nretaliated against by their employer as the \nresult of requesting an inspection or using any \nof their other rights under the OSH Act.\n ■File a complaint if punished or retaliated \nagainst for acting as a “whistleblower” under \nthe 21 additional federal laws for which OSHA \nhas jurisdiction.\nFor more information, visit OSHA’s Workers’ Rights \npage at www.osha.gov/workers.html . \nOSHA ASSISTANCE, SERVICES AND PROGRAMS\nOSHA offers free compliance assistance to \nemployers and workers.

The Instruction also establishes safety and health programs as \nidentified in subsequent chapters for Regional imp lementation.  Employee \nparticipation is a key element of any successful SHMS.  It is the intent of \nthis program that all employees will participate in all aspects including \nreporting hazards, incidents, and injury/illness without fear of reprisal.  \nChanges  to the SHMS or programs that alter the SHMS or program \npolicies require National Office review and approval.   \n \nScope:  OSHA -wide  \n \nReferences:  Occupational Safety and Health Act, Public Law 91 -596  \n \n Presidential Executive Order 12196 of February 26, 1980  \n  \n Title 29: Subtitle B --Regulations Relating to Labor: Chapter XVII \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, Department of Labor  \n \n Department of Labor Manual Series (DLMS) 4, Chapter 800, DOL Safety \nand Health Program  \n \n See also Reference paragraph s in individual chapters.  \n \nCancellations:  OSHA Instruction ADM 04 -00-002, OSHA Field Safety and Health \nManual,  October 5, 2016  \n \nState Impact:  None.

The Instruction also establishes safety and health programs, as identified in \nsubsequent chapters, for Directorate/Regional implementation.   \n \nThe SHMS and its p rograms establish baseline requirements and within established guidelines, \nmay be supplemented or augmented to ensure the safety and health of all OSHA employees as \nwell as temporary and contract employees. Changes related to the implementation of SHMS may  \nbe made with local SHMS committee approval.  Changes to the SHMS or programs that alter \nSHMS or program policies require National Labor -Management Steering Committee review and \napproval.   \n \nThe SHMS and its programs will be implemented in phases per the timetable that will be \nprovided by Directorate of Technical Support and Emergency Management (DTSEM).  \nNothing in the instruction eliminates the Regional Administrator or Directorate’s obligations to \ncomply with OSHA or other Federal Regulations and Executi ve Orders.    \n \n \nSignificant Changes  \n \nAppendix B from Chapter 22: Electrical Safety was removed because the equipment listed was \nnot meeting the desired intent, which was to list equipment that requires advanced training (i.e. \nQualified Persons). The need for on -the-job training, approval, and potentially Qualified Persons \ntraining before using electrical testing equipment was clarified in a way that allows flexibility in \nthe Regions and as equipment changes.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis Page Intentionally Left Blank  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n \n TABLE OF CONTENTS  \nCHAPTER 1.

INTRODUCTION  \nI. Purpose  \nThe purpose of this Instruction is to define and implement a Field Safety and Health \nManagement System (SHMS) and appropriate safety and health programs, as identified \nin the subsequent chapters, for OSHA.  \nOSHA is responsible for ensuring that employees o f the Agency have a safe and healthful \nworkplace that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Act and with OSHA \nstandards. Establishing an effective SHMS appropriate to employees’ varied work \nresponsibilities and workplace conditions is also an es sential strategy to eliminate/control \nhazards before they lead to fatalities, injuries and illnesses.  \nII. Scope  \nThis Instruction applies OSHA -wide.  \nDue to the unique technical support the Health Response Team (HRT) provides to the \nfield, it may develop polic ies and procedures, not covered by this Instruction, to protect \nHRT employees from specific hazards during work activities only the HRT is expected to \nconduct.  These policies and procedures will comply with OSHA standards while \nallowing the HRT to provide  support to the field during emergent or critical situations.  \nThe HRT is a branch of the Salt Lake Technical Center, Directorate of Technical Support \nand Emergency Management.  \nIII.

Changes to Existing MOUs  \nRegions that have preexisting Memorandums Of Understanding (MOU) and/or safety and \nhealth management programs need to review them against this Safety and Health \nManagement System to ensure consistency.  The MOUs and any program po rtions that \nare not consistent need to be sent to the Directorate of Technical Support and Emergency \nManagement with justification for why the deviation is necessary.  A final determination \nwill be made by the joint labor – management steering committee.  \n  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 2-3 CHAPTER 2.  SAFETY AND HEALTH MA NAGEMENT SYSTEM  \nThe basic tenets of an effective SHMS are Management Commitment and Leadership , Employee \nParticipation, Worksite Analysis, Hazard Prevention and Control and Safety and Health \nTraining.  \nI. Management Commitment and Leaders hip \n Policy Statement  \nIt is the policy of the Agency to provide a safe and healthful work environment \nfor all permanent, temporary, and contract employees.  It is also our policy to \nprovide the same safe and healthful environment for our visitors.  OSHA is not \nonly committed to ensuring a safe and healthful work environment for others, but \nis equally committed to the safety and health of its employees. The development, \nimplementation, and evaluation of this Safety and Health Management System \n(SHMS) shall be  a cooperative effort between labor and management in order to \nprevent injuries, illnesses, and death from work -related causes and minimize \nlosses of material resources. The information contained in this SHMS shall be \nused to assist employees and superviso rs in carrying out their responsibilities of \nensuring a safe and healthful working environment.  \nThis SHMS establishes the framework of a continuing process for providing \noccupational safety and health guidelines and information to all personnel. \nOSHA’s co mmitment is to ensure continuous improvement by establishing \nprocedures for annual self -evaluation and follow -up.  The safety, health, and well -\nbeing of OSHA’s Federal employees, contractors, and members of the visiting \npublic are a shared responsibility. Management will provide training and the time \nnecessary for successful implementation of all aspects of this program.  \n Roles and Responsibilities  \n1. National Office  \na. The Assistant Secretary bears responsibility for the health and \nsafety of OSHA employees as well as temporary, contract and \nvisiting employees and will demonstrate leadership and \ncommitment for employee safety and health.   The Assistant \nSecretary will hold Regional Administrators  accountable for the \nSHMS  and programs within their respective offic es. \nb. The National Field Safety and Health Steering Committee consists \nof three executive field management representatives and three \nNCFLL representatives.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 2-4 2.

Employee Participation  \n Each employee covered by this instruction is responsible for:  \n1. Following all of the safety and health rules and practices of the SHMS and \nsafety and health programs;  \n2. Monitoring and reporting to their supervisor (or designee) any unsafe \nconditions for prompt corr ection;  \n3. Correcting any hazard that they have the ability to correct and report that \nevent to the applicable supervisor (or designee), e.g. their Regional \nAdministrator/Area Director/Unit Manager and/or Assistant Area Director \n(AAD)/ appropriate OSHA manager ; \n4. Providing feedback to their applicable supervisor (or designee) regarding \nthe need for additional controls to ensure safety and health standards are \nmet; \n5. Setting the example as a leader in occupational safety and health to others \nin the course of their p rofessional duties ;  \n6. Avoiding exposure to any recognized uncontrolled hazard ; and   \n7. Participating meaningfully in SHMS activities, for example; preparing Job \nHazard Analyses (JHA), conducting accident investigations, and serving \non safety and health committ ees. \n All employees shall be provided access to: training materials; safety data sheets; \nresults of inspections; evaluations of their own SHMS; results of accident \ninvestigations except for portions deemed confidential for personnel or medical \nreasons; haza rd assessments and such other materials produced by the SHMS that \nmay be helpful to employees in improving safety and health in their workplace.  \n Union and employee participation in the field are to be undertaken consistent with the \nNational Council of Fiel d Labor Locals (NCFLL) bargaining agreement.    \n Each Region shall establish a joint labor management committee referred to as the \nRegional Safety and Health Committee (RSHC) to promote occupational safety and \nhealth benefits to all employees, including tem porary, contract, and visiting \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 2-6 employees.  The requirements for formation and election of the RSHC and \nchairperson will be consistent with 29 CFR 1960.37.  The size of the RSHC will be \ndetermined jointly by the local labor -management representatives.  \n1. The R SHC will consist of at least as many bargaining unit representatives \nas management representatives.  The NCFLL will appoint the union \nrepresentatives and the Regional Administrator will appoint the \nmanagement representatives.  \n2. Each committee member will ser ve terms of one to three years. The terms \nshould be staggered so that no more than half of the management or union \nmembers will be rotated off the committee's membership during the year.  \n3. A Regional Safety and Health Manager (RSHM), identified by the \nRegio nal Administrator, serves as facilitator and technical advisor and is a \npermanent support position in the committee. This position is in addition \nto the members of the RSHC.  \n4. The RSHC may designate ad hoc work groups as appropriate (with up to \nfour members)  to address specific safety and health issues and work \nassignments.  \nIII. Worksite Analysis  \n Inspections  \nSafety and health inspections will be conducted at each OSHA office quarterly at \na minimum with at least one union and one management representative \nparticipating.  Corrective actions will be documented on the Corrective Action \nList (Appendix A) communicated to all affected employees, and retained at the \noffice where the inspection was conducted for at least two years. Consideration \nshould be given to conducting limited scope monthly inspections (e. g. fire \nextinguisher, eyewash, or emergency lighting inspections).  \n Hazard Analysis of Routine Tasks  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 2-7 1. Hazards and risks to employees' safety and health should be identified and \nassessed on an ongoing basis at b oth the office and field locations, such as at \nenforcement inspection and VPP onsite evaluation locations. Implementation \nof preventive and protective measures should: eliminate the hazard/risk; \ncontrol the hazard/risk at the source  through the use of engi neering controls \nor organizational measures; minimize the hazard/risk by the design of safe \nwork systems or use of administrative control measures; or where residual \nhazards/risks cannot be controlled by collective measures, effected by the use \nof appropri ate personal protective equipment  \n2. Hazard Analyses are effective in uncovering hazards to employees and shall \nbe done to the fullest extent possible for all tasks assigned to employees. \nBased on a general assessment of work sites, at a minimum, employees ar e \nrequired to utilize safety glasses, safety shoes, and hard hats on construction \nsites and safety glasses and safety shoes on all general industry, maritime and \nlong shoring sites. All employees shall abide by the requirements of the \nemployer under inspec tion, if more protective than the general assessment.  \n3. The SHMS program serves as the basic hazard analysis and control for \nroutine tasks.  \n4. To evaluate potential health hazards, employees will abide by OSHA’s \nPolicies and Procedures in Chapter 27 entitled, P olicies and Procedures for \nField Staff Exposure Monitoring.  \n Hazard Analysis of Non Routine Tasks  \n1. When known special hazards are identified prior to the OSHA inspection and \nor evaluation, safe job instructions will be given by the unit manager in these \ncases. \n2. When OSHA employees discover hazards that limit their ability to access an \narea for inspection and or evaluation, they will contact their unit manager \nimmediately.   \n3. When OSHA employees encounters a hazard that is not addressed in the \nSHMS program they will notify their supervisor who will discuss with the \nlocal safety and health committee whether a JSA should be developed.  \n4. When it is determined by the safety and health committee that a JSA be \ndeveloped Appendix C will be utilized.  Any JSAs developed wi ll be \nforwarded to the Regional Safety and Health Committee for review and upon \napproval forwarded to DTSEM for posting.  \n Employee Reporting of Hazards  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 2-8 1. The recognition and control of all types of hazards encountered in the \nperformance of official duties is critical to the safety and health of \nemployees.  \n2. Employees including temporary, contract and visiting employees have the \nright, and are encouraged, to report all working conditions perceived to be \npotential safety or health hazards to their supervisor (or designee) without \nfear of reprisal.  \n3. In order to capture such incidents as chemical overexposures, near misses, \nvehicle accidents, and office hazards, employees shall report workplace \nhazards and provide the information necessary to complete the Incident \nInvestigation and Hazard Reporting Worksheet (Reporting Worksheet) as \nsoon as possible to his or her supervisor (or designee). Once submitted, \ninvestigations of these incidents are initiated as soon as possible, but within \nthree working days.  \n4. Reported hazar d(s) are documented on the Incident Investigation and Hazard \nReporting Worksheet (Reporting Worksheet) and submitted to the RSHM \nand union official within 24 hours.  Corrective action(s) dates shall be \ntracked on the Corrective Action List (Corrective Acti on List). The \nsupervisor (or designee) shall ensure that employees and the union official \nare notified in writing within 15 work days of the corrective actions taken or \nare pending and the reason why.  \n5. Reports of unsafe conditions may also be submitted to any local management \nor the Department of Labor on line using DL 1 -1097 Form, Reporting Unsafe \nand Unhealthful Conditions located at \nhttps://shimshosting.dol.gov/login/ShimsLogin.aspx ). Rep orts may be \nsubmitted anonymously.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for \nAdministration and Management (OASAM) Safety and Health Manager will \ninvestigate and respond appropriately to the hazard(s) identified, within \nrequired timeframes.  \nIV. Incident Repor ting/Investigation Procedures  \n Prompt and accurate reporting and investigation of work -related “incidents,” which \ninclude all work -related injuries, illnesses and near misses, or accidents that could \nhave caused serious injuries, is a necessary component of  effective accident \nprevention programs.  This information can be used in evaluating and preventing \nhazards, fulfilling mandatory recordkeeping requirements and filing for workers’ \ncompensation benefits.  Incidents resulting in personal injury and/or illne ss require \nthat the appropriate Office of Worker’s Compensation Programs (OWCP) and DOL \nprocedures are followed and forms completed.   \n The supervisor  (or designee) will notify the  Regional Administrator within one \nworkday of all incidents involving recorda ble injuries and illnesses.  Th e Incident \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 2-9 Investigation and Hazard Reporting Worksheet  (Reporting Worksheet ) will be \ncompleted by the manager  or designated coordinator.    \n The supervisor (or designee) will notify the Regional Administrator within one \nworkday of all incidents involving recordable injuries and illnesses.  The Incident \nInvestigation and Hazard Reporting Worksheet (Reporting Worksheet) will be \ncompleted by the m anager or designated coordinator.     \nFor Regions, the Worksheet is sent to the RSHM within five days of the incident \ncorrection due date.  The Worksheet shall include the action plan to correct the \nincident.  Copies are kept at the office for employees to  review.  \n Incidents involving property damage shall be reported as soon as possible to the \nmanager (or designee). The manager (or designee) will complete the Incident \nInvestigation and Hazard Reporting Worksheet (Reporting Worksheet) and will be \ninvolved in  the investigation process.  \n1. In the Regions, all incidents involving property damage must be reported to \nthe RSHM within one workday. An Incident Investigation and Hazard \nReporting Worksheet (Reporting Worksheet) and supporting information \nshall be sent imm ediately to the RSHM.  \n2. In addition to the reporting requirements outlined in this directive and in the \nDepartment of Labor Management Series (DLMS) 4, Chapter 800, DOL \nSafety and Health Program, employees and supervisors must fully adhere to \nDOL accident r eporting requirements in DLMS 2, Chapter 1500, Motor \nVehicle Management. These requirements are in addition to the Motor \nVehicle Accident Report (SF 91) that must be completed and submitted to \nDTSEM in the National Office and the RSHM in the Regions.  \n Each  office must maintain their own recordkeeping forms in accordance with 29 CFR \nPart 1904 for injuries/illnesses occurring at their facilities or work areas.  In addition, \neach office will follow DOL requirements in regards to the use of SHIMS.  \nThe RSHM will  maintain the recordkeeping forms in accordance with 1904 for \nthe Regional Office. Completed Incident Investigation and Hazard Reporting \nWorksheet (Reporting Worksheet) are sent to the RSHM within five days of the \nincident correction due date.  Copies are kept at the office for employees to \nreview.  \nV. Hazard Prevention and Control  \n Hazard prevention and control procedures must be reviewed and modified as \nnecessary on a regular basis to follow the most current laws and regulations  and to \nensure that the fullest level of protection is provided . \n Supervisors (or designees) are responsible for ensuring that employees comply with \nall safety and health rules, policies, and programs and are required to take appropriate \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 2-10 action to prevent injury or illness to employees. S pecific actions to be taken will be in \naccordance with existing personnel practices and regulations.  \n Employees including temporary, contract and visiting employees are required to wear \nrequired Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as outlined below and in the PPE \nProgram.  \n1. At the start of any inspection/audit or other field activity, the employees will \nassess the need for PPE, which will include the employer’s PPE assessment.  \n2. Employees including temporary, contract and visiting employees will abide \nby OSHA’s  PPE Program (Chapter 8) or the program of the employer under \ninspection or other field activity, whichever requires greater protection.  \n3. If during the course of an inspection/audit or other field activity the employee \nencounters a hazardous condition requi ring the use of PPE not addressed by \nthe employer’s PPE hazard assessment, the employee will promptly address \nthe hazardous condition with the employer.  The employee will also don the \nappropriate PPE before proceeding, unless other appropriate action \neliminates the hazard.  \n4. Supervisors will periodically evaluate the employee use of PPE to ensure that \nemployees are adequately protected.  \nVI. Safety and Health Training  \nThe following procedures apply to supervisors (or designees) in the Regions:   \n The supervisor (or designee) will ensure that all employees are trained initially and \ngiven refresher training as appropriate on an annual basis thereafter.  \n1. Employee training will include all relevant Chapters of the SHMS and \nspecific safety and health programs.  \n2. Speciali zed technical training will be provided for employees who may \nencounter unique hazards associated with a particular industry or hazard.  \n3. Supervisors and employees who are engaged in safety and health activities \nfor the agency will be trained to conduct thos e duties.  \n The supervisor (or designee) will ensure that new employees are provided training on \nthis Instruction as part of a DOL new employee orientation process.  \n Training will be accomplished within 30 days after a new or updated chapter is \nreleased.  Emp loyees will be trained on the emergency action plan when first hired, \nand notified, and trained as necessary, whenever the plan has changed or whenever \nany person's responsibilities under the plan have changed.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 2-11 \n Records of training will be maintained for th ree years at the Regional or Office level \nto ensure that all employees have been appropriately trained.  \n Supervisors (or designees) will make available records of the training conducted to \nthe Regional Administrator, and DTSEM when requested.  \n Supervisors (o r designees) will ensure that appropriate training is provided to \ntemporary, contract, and visiting employees to ensure their safety.  \nVII. Specific Safety and Health Programs  \n Safety and health programs for the specific topics identified in the subsequent \nchapte rs must be adopted and implemented.  These may be supplemented or \naugmented to enhance employee safety and health.  Safety and health on additional \ntopics may also be adopted and implemented to address unique safety and health \ntopics. All safety and health  programs shall ensure the highest level of protection for \nemployees, temporary employees, contractors, and the visiting public consistent with \nexisting rules, standards and guidance.  \n All changes to the SHMS or programs other than those that describe site  specific roles \nand responsibilities must be submitted to the DTSEM for review and approval using \nthe following procedures.  \nDTSEM in conjunction with the joint Labor -Management Committee is to review \nand respond to the Region within 60 days of receipt of c hanges to policies and \nprocedures.  \n The SHMS and programs provide baseline guidance to OSHA in order to implement \nan effective SHMS to prevent employee injuries, illnesses and fatalities.

EMERGENCY CONTINGENC Y PLAN  \nI. Purpose  \nThe purpose of this plan is to ensure each employee of OSHA is provided a safe \nworking environment. The  emergency contingency plan has been developed to \nprovide an organized plan of action to prepare and respond to major natural and \nhuman -caused emergencies that threaten OSHA offices.  OSHA employees \nresponding to emergencies outside the local office will f ollow the procedures and \nplans specified in the Regional Emergency Management Plan (REMP) .   \nII. Scope  \nThe program applies to all OSHA employees and addresses emergencies affecting \nthe continued operation of the OSHA office.  This Chapter  includes the f ollowin g \nemergency action plans.  \n Shelter in Place Plan (SIPP).  The SIPP protects occupants in the event of a \nhazardous materials release in the community or for other scenarios when it \nwould be safer to remain in the building.  \n Local Contingency Plans for the Admi nistrative Closing of Offices During \nEmergency Situations.  This emergency action plan authorizes the \nadministrative closing of OSHA offices for brief periods of time because of \nemergency conditions.  \n Occupant Emergency Plan (OEP). T he OEP contains procedure s to keep \nOSHA employees and visitors safe at the office.  The plan covers medical \nemergencies, fire, bomb threats and the handling of suspicious packages.  \nIII. Definitions  \n Emergency.   Any incident, human -caused or natural , that requires responsive \naction to protect life and property . \n  Event .  A planned, non -emergency activity.  \n  Natural Emergencies.   Major fires, hurricanes, earthquake, tornadoes, snow \nand severe weather . \n  Human -Caused Emergencies.

Development  and implementation of office specific emergency \nprograms ; \n2. Employees  are trained on emergency proc edures;  \n3. Exercises  are conducted to evaluate the effectivenes s of the \nemergency action plans; and  \n4. Maintenance of training records and documentation rel ated to \nincidents and exercises.  \n Employees are responsible for:  \n1. Attending emergency training;  \n2. Reporting po tential emergency situations to their responsible OSHA \nManager(s) ; and \n3. Following emergency action plans as directed.  \nV. Procedures  \n Each  office will develop emergency plans applicable to their needs using the \nfollowing templates contained in the Appendices  at the end of this chapter .  \nThe templates are intended to serve as guides and may work well in some \noffice settings, but not in all.  \n Emergencies will be assessed by the responsible OSHA Manager(s) and/or \nemergency personnel for size and the potential to caus e injury or illness to \nOSHA employees . The appropriate emergency plan will be implemented \nbased upon the nature and seriousness of the emergency.  \n Exercises  will be conducted annually to evaluate the effectiveness of the \nplans.  \n Any time an emergency plan is  implemented, whether it is for an actual \nemergency or an exercise, the response will be documented.  The \ndocumentation will include the date, description of the scenario, actions taken \nor parts of the plan implemented, participants, and critique.  The cri tique will \nidentify what went well and what areas need improvement.  Plans will be \nmodified as necessary to correct deficiencies.  \nVI.

This plan \naddresses all such types of emergencies whether they are the result of an accidental \nrelease or a national security incident.  This plan has been developed by the Department \nof Labor – OSHA.  \n \nThe ___________________ Shelter -in-Place emergency procedures will be initiated \nbased upon information from local police and fire department officials indicating it is \nsafer for occupants to remain in the building than to evacuate to the outside.   \nAlthough this Shelter -in-Place Plan is aimed primarily at protecting occupants in the \nevent of a hazardous materials release, the procedures may also be invoked under other \nscenarios when it would be safer to remain in the building, such as gunf ire in the \nimmediate vicinity of the building or an imminent tornado.  \nShelter -in-place may not be appropriate for all incidents.  Every shelter -in-place situation \nmust be assessed on a case -by-case basis to determine the applicable course of action.  \n \nShelt er-in-Place Announcements  \nIn the event that it is necessary to initiate shelter -in-place procedures, the responsible \nOSHA Manager(s) will notify all OSHA employees.  Management will contact OSHA \nstaff members working remotely, advising them not to return t o the Office until further \nnotice.  \nAll OSHA employees, contractors, and visitors should follow instructions from \ndesignated managers, and be alert to periodic updates broadcast via the public address \nsystem.  \nDuring the shelter -in-place emergency, managemen t staff will be working to enhance \nbuilding safety.  This will include implementing emergency ventilation shutdown \nprocedures and, where appropriate, securing all doors.  \nDuring the duration of the emergency monitoring for carbon dioxide shall be conducted \nto insure air quality in the facility.  \n \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 7-46 Relocating to Designated Shelter Areas Within the Building  \nAll OSHA employees, contractors, and visitors should:  \n Relocate to designated shelter areas in the building .  Visitors should accompany the \nemployee they are visiting to the employee’s designated shelter area.  \n Close doors to vacated offices (do not lock them) . \n Account for all office staff expected in the shelter area (e.g. responsible OSHA \nManager(s) may use sign -in sheets to assess who is at work and their location) .  \n Listen carefully for instructions from authorized personnel, such as responsible \nOSHA Manager(s) Remain in the shelter area until an “all clear” message has been \nannounced or an evacuation is ordered.  \n \nCritical Information for Employees  \nThe pri mary focus of this Shelter -in-Place Plan is to minimize damage from a hazardous \nmaterials release outside the building.  Typically, shelter -in-place conditions will last \nfrom a few minutes to a few hours.  It is not anticipated that employees would remain in \nthe building overnight.  \nShelter -in-place cannot be mandated by your agency.  However, building management or \nlocal emergency response personnel can require shelter -in-place to be put into effect.  For \neveryone’s safety, employees must proceed directly to a designated shelter area.   \nOpening an outside door could put you in contact with a harmful contaminant,  or allow \ndangerous air to enter the building and put others at risk. Information available to you \nabout conditions outside the building and the thr eats posed by those conditions may be \nlimited and incomplete.   \nShould you leave the building , you very likely will not be allowed re -entry.  You may \nalso find that the location you travel to may not allow you access to that facility, since \nthey may be she ltering -in-place.  If you have children in a nearby childcare facility, ask \nthem to describe their shelter -in-place procedures and whether it will be possible to \ncontact them while they are in a sheltering mode . \nYou should also be aware that conditions are  likely to get uncomfortable, as the \nmaintenance staff will immediately shut down the ventilation system to reduce the chance \nof contamination entering the building.  The close quarters, heat, and stuffiness will add \nto your discomfort.  Please remain calm  and assist those around you to cope with the \nsituation.  \n \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 7-47  \nResponsibilities of Emergency Response Team Members  \nMembers of management will assist in the quick and orderly movement of building \noccupants into designated shelter areas, using prescribed evacuat ion routes or \nimmediately establishing a new evacuation route if a prescribed route is endangered or \ninaccessible.  They will ensure that other rooms on the floor are clear of any personnel, \nand will keep security staff apprised of the status on each floor .    \n \nIssuance of “All Clear” Message  \nWhen it is safe to resume normal operations, an “all clear” message will be transmitted \n____________________________ . \n \nDesignated Shelter Areas  \nAll OSHA employees  should become familiar with the location of the designated shelter \nareas for their offices.  Typically, a shelter area will be on the same floor in the vicinity of \nthe employees’ workstations, and will be away from all exterior windows.  Designated \nshelte r areas are _________________________________ . \n \nEssential Supplies  \n_________________________  will provide all OSHA employees , contractors, and \nvisitors with basic essential supplies during a shelter -in-place incident.  The responsible \nOSHA Manager(s) will be responsible for distribution of supplies in the shelter area, if \nappropriate.  Generally, water and nutritional supplements will not be distributed unless it \nappears the incident will last an hour or longer. The  provisions in the shelter area will \ninclu de:  \n Water;  \n Nutritional supplement;  \n Flashlights and/or chemical light sticks;  \n First aid supplies; and  \n Self-powered radio.  \n \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 7-48  \nMedical and Personal Preparedness  \nOSHA employees  should evaluate their personal medical and dietary needs and plan \naccordingly.  Thi s includes a sking your doctor about appropriate storage for prescription \nmedications, such as heart and high blood pressure medication, insulin, or other \nprescription drugs.  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security advises that you also \nconsider any other  special needs, such as wearing prescribed alert tags and bracelets to \nhelp identify any disability or medical condition, as well as other comfort items.  \n \nFurther details about the Shelter -in-Place plan for this building \n__________________________.  \n \nQuesti ons or concerns about this plan should be directed to ____________________  at \n________________________.  \n  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 7-49 APPENDIX B  \nLocal Contingency Plan  \n \nAdministrative Closing of  \nOffices During Emergency Situations  \n \n__________________________     ____________________  \n  (Designated Local Official)          (Date)  \n \n1.

PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT  \nI. Purpose  \nThe object of this Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Program is to protect employees \nfrom the risk of injury by creating a barrier against workplace hazards.  PPE wil l be \nprovided, used, and maintained when it has been determined that its use is required and \nthat such use will lessen the likelihood of occupational injury and/or illness.  \nII. Scope  \nThe program applies to all employees required to wear PPE.  This program addr esses all \nforms of PPE except respiratory and hearing protection, which are addressed in separate \nchapters.   \nIII. Responsibilities  \n Responsible OSHA Manager(s) have the primary responsibility for implementation of \nthe PPE Program in their work area. Responsible  OSHA Manager(s) will:  \n1. Provide appropriate PPE and make it available to employees;  \n2. Ensure and certify completion of a PPE assessment;  \n3. Ensure employees are trained on the proper use, care, and cleaning of PPE;  \n4. Maintain records of training and PPE supplied;  \n5. Supervise employees to ensure that the PPE Program elements are followed \nand that employees properly use and care for PPE;  \n6. Ensure defective or damaged equipment is immediately removed from \nservice;  \n7. Ensure proper disposal and cleaning of contaminated PPE; and  \n8. Designate a PPE coordinator to supervise the distribution, maintenance, and \ncare of equipment.  \n OSHA employees are responsible for conforming to the requirements of this policy. \nEmployees will:  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 8-2 1. Wear PPE as necessary;  \n2. Attend PPE training sessions;  \n3. Care for, clean, maintain and dispose of PPE as necessary; and  \n4. Report any damaged or defective PPE to their responsible OSHA \nManager(s).  \nIV. Procedure  \n Hazard Assessment  \n1. Based on a general assessment of all work sites, it is OSHA policy that all \nOSHA employees  will utilize safety glasses, safety shoes and hard hats on \nconstruction sites and safety glasses and safety shoes on all general industrial \nsites.  OSHA field personnel will also abide by any required PPE based on \nthe local office hazard assessment or OSH A JHAs.  \n2. At the start of any inspection/audit or other field activity, the OSHA \nemployee will assess the need for PPE, which would include the employer’s \nPPE assessment.  \n3. The OSHA employee will abide by the employer’s or OSHA’s PPE policy, \nwhichever requires  the greater protection.  \n4. If in the course of an inspection/audit or other field activity, the OSHA \nprofessional encounters a hazardous condition requiring the use of PPE, not \naddressed by the employer’s PPE hazard assessment, the OSHA employee \nwill promptl y address the hazardous condition with the employer, and don \nthe appropriate PPE before proceeding unless other appropriate action \neliminates the hazard.  \n5.

Ladders will be selected for the work in tended.  \n2. Make sure the ladder is the proper height for the job.  Extension ladders will \nbe at least 3 feet taller than the point of support and stepladders will be \nselected so that the worker is never required to use the top two steps.  \n3. Inspect ladders befo re use.  Defective ladders will not be used.  Some signs \nof defects include: broken rungs, split side rails, worn or broken safety feet, \nbroken hinges an d spreaders, loose nuts, bolt s and/or rivets.  If defective, \nremove ladder from service and place a war ning tag reading on it “DO NOT \nUSE.”   \n4. When using a straight ladder, place feet on a firm surface and secure it at the \ntop so that it cannot slide sideways.  \n5. Always face the ladder when climbing or descending.  Use both hands – \nnever carry anything in your  hands.  You have climbed too high if your knees \nare above the top of the ladder or if you cannot maintain a handhold on the \nladder.  \n6. There should only be one person on a ladder at any time unless designed for \nmultiple users.  \n7. Do not use metal ladders if the re is the possibility of contact with electrical \nconductors.   \n8. Never use a stepladder as a straight ladder.  \n9. Do not use stepladders as a brace or support for a work platform or plank.  \n10.  Never lean from the side of a ladder.  If necessary, the task will be ev aluated \nfor potential fall hazards.  Other alternative solutions will be used to allow a \nsafe approach to the task.  \n Stairs, ramps and walkways will be clear and in good condition.  Always us e the \nhandrail provided when ascending or descending stairs.  \n Employees will be cautioned to watch for holes, concrete dividers, curbs, discarded \nitems, paper and other tripping hazards.  \n During cold weather, employees will be cautioned about icy conditions on walkways \nand parking lots.  \n Floor holes and openings will  be protected by a cover or standard railing.  Should the \ncover or railing need to be removed, the floor opening or hole will be constantly \nattended by an attendant assigned to warn others of the hazard.   \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 11-24 \n Open -sided floors or platforms that are four or mo re feet above ground level will be \nprovided with proper standard railing.  When there is equipment that could fall from \nthese elevations, the installation of a standard toe board is required.   \n Scaffolds.  \nThere are several different types of scaffolds.  Access to elevated locations or work at \nheights requires guardrails, fall protection, or a personal fall arrest systems device.  \nEmployees will be cautioned that if the work cannot be performed from the ground or \nby other available means, the following gen eral requirements for scaffolding will be \nmet: \n1. Scaffolds will be used only when work cannot be performed from the ground \nor from solid construction.   \n2. Footing or anchorage for scaffolds will be sound, rigid, and capable of \ncarrying the intended load withou t settling or displacement.  Unstable \nobjects, including barrels, boxes, loose bricks or concrete blocks, will not be \nused to support scaffolds or planks.  The use of base plates and mudsills is \nacceptable.  \n3. Access to the scaffold must be provided by a lad der, ramp, or other safe \nmeans.  Never use the side frames to access the scaffold.  \n4. Scaffolds must be fully planked.  The planks will not extend less than six \ninches and not more than 18 inches from the end.  \n5. Scaffolds will not be used during storms, high wind, or when covered by ice \nor snow.  \n6. Scaffolds over 10 feet from ground level must have standard guardrails, \ntoeboards, and will be properly cross -braced.  \n7. Mobile ladder stands and scaffolds will have positive wheel and/or swivel \nlock casters to prevent movement.  \n \n \n \n \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 12-25 CHAPTER 12.  HAZARD COMMUNICATION  \nI. Purpose  \nIt is OSHA’s policy to comply with the requirements of OSHA’s Hazard Communication \nStandard (HCS), 29 CFR 1910.1200.  \nII. Scope  \nThis program applies to all work operations where there is exposure to hazardous \nchemical s that are known to be present in the workplace in such a manner that employees \nmay be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable emergency.  The mere \npresence of a hazardous chemical in the workplace does not trigger coverage under the \nHCS .  There must be actual or potential exposure to an employee.  Consumer products \nare not covered by this program to the extent that the use of the products results in a \nduration and frequency of exposure that is not greater tha n that which could be \nreasona bly be experienced by consumers.   \nIII. Responsibilities  \n Area Offices  – responsible OSHA Manager(s) is the coordinator of the Hazard \nCommunication Program (HCP) in his or her office, acting as the representative of \nthe Regional Administrator.  \n1. He or she may delegate the day -to-day responsibility for the HCP to one of \nthe Assistant Area Directors or a senior industrial hygienist.  \n2. Ultimate responsibility for the development and implementation of the \nprogram in each Area Office remains with the responsible OSHA  \nManager(s).   \n Regional Offices  – the Regional Hazard Communication Coordinator  (RHCC), acting \nas the representative of the Regional Administrator, will have responsibility for the \ndevelopment and implementation of the program in the Regional Office, as we ll as \nact as overall coordinator for the program.  For purposes of this program, the \nresponsible OSHA Manager(s) and RHCC have the same responsibilities.   \nIV. Procedure  \n List of Hazardous Chemicals  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 12-26 1. A list will be maintained of all hazardous chemicals used in t he office and \nupdated as necessary.  This list will be developed by each office and become \na part of this program as an attachment.   \n2. The list will identify the corresponding Safety Data Sheet ( SDS) for each \nchemical.  \n Safety Data Sheet  \n1. A copy of a n SDS for every substance on the list of hazardous chemicals in \nthe Regional/Area office will be maintained.  \n2. SDSs for all hazardous chemicals used in the Regional/Area Office will be \nreadily accessible to employees at all times.   \n3. Requisitions for hazardous chemi cals are to include a request for the SDS.  \nAll SDSs will be reviewed for content and completeness. Additional research \nwill be done if necessary.  \n4. SDSs of new material to be purchased must be reviewed and the chemical \napproved for use by the responsible OS HA Manager(s) /RHCC or his or her \ndesignee.  Whenever possible, the least hazardous substance will be obtained.   \n Warning Labels  \n1. All containers of hazardous chemicals in the office will be properly labeled.   \n2. All labels will include the identity of the haz ardous chemical and the \nappropriate hazard warning, including the target organ effects.   \n3. Each label will be checked with the corresponding SDS to verify the \ninformation.   \n4. Alternate labeling provisions, such as tags or markings, may be made for \ncontainers  that are of unusual shape or size and do not easily accommodate a \nlegible label.   \n5. Chemicals that are transferred from a properly labeled container to a portable \ncontainer, and that are intended only for the immediate use of the person who \nperforms the tr ansfer are not required to be labeled.  Immediate use is defined \nin 29 CFR 1910.1200.  \n  Training  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 12-27 1. Each employee who is potentially exposed to hazardous chemicals will \nreceive training as outlined in this Chapter.  \n2. New employees will receive training on the contents of this program and \nspecific training on the chemicals that the individuals will be directly \nworking with during orientation and prior to performing work where \nexposure may occur.  \n3. Additional training wil l be provided for employees whenever a new chemical \nis introduced into their work area.   \n4. As warranted, training may be provided based on the uniqueness of the \nhazards to be encountered at an inspection worksite.   \n5. The training program will emphasize the f ollowing elements:  \na. A summary of the HCS and the written program;  \nb. Hazardous chemical properties, including visual appearance and odor, \nand methods that can be used to detect the presence or release of \nhazardous chemicals;  \nc. Physical and health hazards associ ated with potential exposure to \nhazardous chemicals;  \nd. Procedures to protect against hazards, such as personal protective \nequipment, work practices, and emergency procedures;  \ne. Hazardous chemical spill and leak procedures; and  \nf. Location of SDSs, how to unders tand their content, and how \nemployees may obtain and use appropriate hazard information.  \n Hazardous Chemicals Encountered on Work Sites  \nRecognizing that the greatest potential for exposure to hazardous chemicals involves \nfield exposures during the course of on -site activities, the following issues will be \nconsidered:  \n1. Field employees will identify potential hazards using the employer’s list of \nhazardous chemicals and associated SDSs and labeling system.  \na. Ensure that appropriate protective measures, including  personal \nprotective equipment, are available and utilized.   \nb. Where protective measures are not adequate, OSHA employees must \navoid exposure and contact their responsible OSHA Manager(s) \n/RHCC.   \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 13-28 2. Samples collected during any on -site activity that may prese nt a potential \nhazard to OSHA employees will be handled in accordance with procedures \noutlined by OSHA’s Salt Lake City Technical Center.  \n Contract Employees  \n1. Outside contractors will be advised of any chemical hazards that may be \nencountered in the normal course of their work in OSHA offices.   \n2. Outside contractors will be notified of the location and availability of SDSs.   \n3. Each contractor bringing chemicals on -site must provide OSHA with the \nappropriate hazard information, including SDSs.  All containers of hazardous \nchemicals brought on -site by an outside contractor must be appropriately \nlabeled.  \n Non-Routine Tasks  \nIf a non -routine task is planned in an OSHA office, affected employees must be \ninformed of any chemical hazards associated with the performanc e of the task(s) and \nappropriate protective measures before such work is initiated.   \n \nCHAPTER 13.  CONTROL OF HAZARDOUS  ENERGY SOURCES  \nI. Purpose  \nThis chapter establishes the OSHA Field Safety and Health Management System \n(SHMS) National Lockout/Tagout (LO/TO) Program.  The policies and procedures in \nthis Program are intended to set broad expectations for preventing OSHA employee \ninjury or death from uncontrolled hazardous energy sources when there are no \nalternatives to conducting work activities where energy isolation i s required.  OSHA \nexpects Regions, DTSEM and DTE to develop specific procedures that align with this \nprogram as needed.  \nThis Program is designed to protect OSHA employees from the inadvertent or unintended \nrelease of energy, movement, or flow in electrica l potential, mechanical, or material \nsystems, which could result in an injury or fatality to outside personnel as defined in 29 \nCFR 1910.147(f)(2).  Locally developed OSHA procedures that align with this LO/TO \nProgram will ensure that all potentially hazar dous energy from machines or equipment is \nisolated using lockout devices before OSHA employees perform any activities (e.g., \ninspections) where unexpected energizing, start up, or release of stored energy could \ncause an injury or a fatality.  \n \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 13-29 All OSHA empl oyees are considered affected employees because their jobs required \nthem to likely work in an area in which machine or equipment servicing and maintenance \nis being performed. For the rare occasion when lockout devices are determined necessary, \nmanagement w ill determine if and when a limited number of OSHA employees are \nconsidered authorized employees.  If Directorate Directors, Regional Administrators \n(RA), and Area Directors (AD) decide employees under their supervision will never be \nconsidered authorized employees, only the annual training requirements for affected \nemployees in this program apply to that Region/Directorate.   \nThis Program assumes that OSHA is the outside employer and authorized OSHA \nemployees may conduct work activities as outside personne l. Normally, OSHA \nemployees are not expected to put themselves in a position that would require isolating \nhazardous energy sources.  However, work activities that require taking measurements or \nvisually inspecting equipment at an on -site employer’s worksit e is considered \nmaintenance or servicing. LO/TO program requirements apply if there is a potential for \nthe unexpected energizing, start up or release of stored energy that could cause injury. \nOnly authorized employees will use this Program to lock out haza rdous energy.  This will \ninclude providing information to the on -site employer about OSHA’s LO/TO procedures \nas required in 29 CFR 1910.147 (f)(2)(i) (see section V.C.1) .  \nThis Program relies on an effective on -site employer LO/TO Program and OSHA \nemployee’s ability to assess its effectiveness during the required information sharing \nabout LO/TO procedures. OSHA employees will not conduct work activities that require \ncontr olling hazardous energy as outside personnel if there is not an effective on -site \nemployer LO/TO Program.  \nII. Scope  \nThis LO/TO Program is intended to apply specifically to OSHA employees covered by \nthe OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual —specifically OSHA empl oyees conducting \nwork activities at another employer’s facility (e. g. inspecting or otherwise visiting \nanother employer's facility), hereinafter referred to as the on-site employer  as established \nin 29 CFR 1910.147 (f)(2)(i).  \nThe procedures in this program do not provide OSHA -owned equipment -specific LO/TO \nprocedures required by 29 CFR 1910.147  for equipment at OSHA facilities .  \nRegions/Directorates that require employees to isolate hazardous energy at OSHA \nfacilities will develop specific LO/TO procedures for applicable OSHA -owned \nequipment that is consistent with, and  at least as protective as, 29 CFR 1910.147. The \nRA/Directorate Director will provide information about LO/TO procedures to personnel \nservicing OSHA equipment as the on-site employer  and will ensure that they are \ninformed about the servicing personnel’s LO/TO procedure s.  \nThis Program also does not apply to hazardous energy in OSHA offices covered in \nChapter 6, Office Safety and Health. When there is a potential for exposure to energized \nparts, Chapter 22, Electrical Safety provides necessary procedures for electrical h azard \nrecognition and avoidance . \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 13-30  \nIII.

Definitions  \n Affected OSHA Employee is an OSHA employee that may conduct activities in an \narea in which LO/TO procedures are being used.  All OSHA employees are \npotentially affected employees since they may encounter LO/TO devices at an OSHA \nfacility or at another employer’s worksite.   \n Authorized OSHA Employee is an OSHA employee authorized by an RA, \nDirectorate Director, Area Office Director or a designee to use a lockout device. \nAuthorized OSHA Employees will use a lock only in a group  lockout that includes \nthe on -site employer’s primary authorized employee in order to perform inspection \nactivity on a machine or piece of equipment.   \n Energy Isolation Device is a mechanical device that physically prevents the \ntransmission or release of e nergy, including but not limited to manually operated \ncircuit breakers, disconnect switches, line valves, a block and any similar devices.  \nPush buttons, selector switches and other control circuits are not acceptable as energy \nisolating devices.  \n Lockout D evice is a device that utilizes a positive means, such as a key or \ncombination lock, to hold an energy isolating device in a safe position and prevent the \nenergizing of a machine or equipment (e.g. blank flanges and bolted slip blinds).  \nEach lockout devic e will be supplied with a tag that meets the requirements of 29 \nCFR 1910.147, is intended for use in group lockout, and includes a tag that identifies \nthe lock user and the application date.  \n Tagout Device is a prominent warning device, such as a tag, and a  means of \nattachment, that can be securely fastened to an energy isolating device in accordance \nwith an established procedure to indicate that the energy isolating device and the \nequipment being controlled may not be operated until the tagout device is rem oved.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 13-31 For this Program, only lockout devices are authorized to control hazardous energy \nand tags are used only to label locks.  \nV. Responsibilities  \n RAs/Directorate Directors and Area Office Directors/equivalents or designees will:  \n1. Decide if employees are aut horized to conduct work activities that require \nLO/TO procedures on rare occasions when no alternatives are available.  \n2. Provide training to affected and authorized OSHA employees as described in \nthis LO/TO Program.  \n3. Request assistance from SLTC’s Health Response Team (HRT) when \ninvestigations and inspections require hazardous energy isolation and the \nRegion or Directorate does not have the resources to safely implement \nLO/TO procedures.  \n4. Develop local procedures that meet requirements in 29 CFR 1910.147 fo r \nOSHA -owned machines and equipment in which the unexpected energization \nor startup of the machines or equipment, or release of stored energy could \nharm OSHA employees or outside servicing personnel.  Determine if \nauthorized OSHA employees are expected to isolate hazardous energy \nsources at their respective OSHA facilities.  Develop and provide site \nspecific information about LO/TO procedures to outside personnel servicing \nOSHA equipment and share information about the servicing personnel’s \nLO/TO procedures  before work begins (29 CFR 1910.147(f)(2)).  \n If RAs, Directorate Directors, Area Office Directors or designees determine that \nauthorized OSHA employees are authorized to use lockout devices as outside \npersonnel, they must:  \n \n1. Develop local procedures for LO /TO program implementation to supplement \nthis Program.  \n2. Select employees who are authorized to implement LO/TO procedures in this \nProgram and that have the knowledge and skills required for the safe \napplication, use, and removal of hazardous energy control devices.  Ensure \nthat selected authorized OSHA employees understand the purpose of the \nLO/TO program and, at a minimum:   \na. Can recognize hazardous energy sources;  \nb. Will represent this chapter and local procedures as OSHA’s LO/TO \nProgram to the on -site employ er as the outside personnel, as required \nby 29 CFR 1910.147(f)(2)(i);  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 13-32 c. Can verify the on -site employers LO/TO program and procedures are \neffective (e.g. interviews and contacting equipment manufacturers);  \nd. Know the importance of considering alternative metho ds and how to \nidentify them for measuring or visually inspecting equipment;  \ne. Know and follow the specific LO/TO procedures described in this \nProgram; and  \nf. Voluntarily accept assigned tasks and is willing to perform authorized \nOSHA employees responsibilities.   Should safety concerns arise when \nlocking out equipment or machines, the OSHA employee may choose \nto end the task, and will discuss safety concerns with the on -site \nemployer and OSHA management from a safe location.  \n3. Issue each Authorized OSHA Employee a lockout device with a key.  The \nlockout device type should be standardized within each Office and in \ncompliance with 29 CFR 1910.147(c)(5) for use in group lockout with at \nleast an on -site employer authorized employee.  \n4. Determine if authorized OSHA employee s will maintain their lockout \ndevices or if all lockout devices will be maintained in a central location until \nthey are needed for approved LO/TO procedures. Include specifics in the \nlocal LO/TO procedures.   \n5. Maintain a spare key for all issued lockout dev ices in a secured area.  This \nkey will be only used with the Area Office Director/designee’s approval.  \nThe spare key may be provided to the authorized OSHA employee if they \nmisplace their key or may be used to remove the lock from an energy isolated \ndevic e in accordance with the procedures in this Program.   \n6. When approving an employee’s request to use LO/TO procedures, consider \nthe following:  \na. Are alternative methods a better option to obtain necessary \ninformation?  \nb. Is the information critical to the inspection?  \nc. Is the  on-site employer LO/TO program effective?  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 13-33 7. Conduct post -use evaluations with the authorized OSHA employee who used \nLO/TO procedures following each approved lock application.  OSHA \nregulation 29 CFR 1910.147(c)(6) requires periodic inspect ions of the \nLO/TO procedure(s) at least annually.  Post -use evaluations, conducted \nfollowing each application, are intended to meet the periodic inspection \nintent (see Appendix A, Control of Hazardous Energy Sources Pre -Request \nfor Approval Checklist and P ost-Application Evaluation).  \n OSHA employees are responsible for following this Program and Region or \nDirectorate specific procedures.  OSHA employees designated as authorized by their \ndirect supervisors with approval from the applicable RA, Directorate Director or Area \nOffice Director  or designee to lock out hazardous energy will:  \n1. Obtain information about the on -site employer’s LO/TO program and \nprovide the on -site employer with the following OSHA LO/TO Program \ndescription orally or in writing to meet requirements in 29 CFR \n1910.147(f )(2)(i) when considering implementing LO/TO procedures at their \nworkplace.   \na. All OSHA employees are considered affected employees.  \nb. A limited number of OSHA employees are authorized employees and \nallowed, only under specific scenarios, to use a lockout devi ce as \noutside personnel conducting equipment inspection activities in \ncoordination with an on -site employer.  \nc. Authorized OSHA employees will verify that the on -site employer \nLO/TO program is effective before proceeding with local OSHA \nmanagement approval p rocesses.  \nd. Authorized OSHA employees will never have the only lockout device \non a controlled hazardous energy source and will only participate in a \ngroup lockout that includes at least one on -site authorized employee.  \ne. At any time, the on -site employer, OS HA employee or their \nmanagement may cancel any activity if it is determined unsafe.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 13-34 2. Perform LO/TO  procedures in accordance with this Program  (e.g. request \napproval, verify host employer program, and notify supervisor when \ncomplete).  \n3. Participat e in post -evaluatio ns conducted by OSHA RA, Directorate Director \nand/or Area Office Director, or designees each time LO/TO procedures are \nimplemented.  \nVI. Safe Alternatives  \nThe following lists some options for alternative methods to obtain information without \nrequiring haz ardous energy isolation:  \n Camera positioned from a safe location (e.g. a camera connected to a n engineering \nrod, camera equipped with zoom lens or video equipment) ; \n Electronic measurement devices used from a safe distance/location (e.g. laser \nmeasurement d evice) ; \n Employer provided diagrams, drawings, hazard assessments and/or inventories of \nenergy sources ; \n Interviews with authorized personnel, maintenance personnel and machine or \nequipment operators ; and  \n Seek assistance from employer -authorized personnel in  obtaining measurements and \nevidence .   \nVII. Procedures  \nAll OSHA employees, when working near equipment that is locked or tagged out , but not \ninspecting equipment that requires hazardous energy controls:  \n1. Do not alter the locks or tags that are in place ; and  \n2. Do not conduct activities that could lead to an exposure to the hazardous \nenergy if released . \nIn the rare occasion when an authorized employee needs to use a LO/TO device, the authorized \nOSHA employee will first consider all other alternatives and ensure that  locking out the machine \nor equipment is absolutely necessary. As outside personnel, the authorized OSHA employee will \nshare information with the on -site employer about equipment -specific LO/TO procedures.  The \nauthorized OSHA employee must verify that the  on-site employer’s procedures are effective in \nidentifying and isolating all applicable hazardous energy sources, and must obtain approval from \nmanagement before applying locks to a group lockout in accordance with this OSHA Program.  \n \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 13-35 \n When inspecting a ma chine or equipment that uses an electrical cord for power and \nthe OSHA employee is required to place any part of his or her body into the point of \noperation or danger zone, the OSHA employee should ask the on -site employer \nrepresentative to unplug it. The OSHA employee must maintain exclusive control of \nthe cord and plug during inspection activities (e.g. lock a plug cap).  \n \n When an OSHA employee makes an initial determination that an inspection activity \n(e.g. taking measurements, conducting a visual inspect ion) may require controlling \nhazardous energy sources, either before or during an inspection, the employee must \nfollow these procedures:  \n1. Consider alternative methods for obtaining the information .  \n2. If no alternatives are identified:  \na. Thoroughly review the o n-site employer’s LO/TO program, including \nany machine -specific procedures, and determine the program’s \neffectiveness.  The OSHA employee must interview the on -site \nemployer’s authorized employee(s) to verify that the on -site \nemployee(s) are thoroughly fam iliar with the equipment, its hazardous \nenergy sources, and any procedures in place for isolating and \ncontrolling hazardous energy.  \nb. Obtain and review any manufacturer’s information on LO/TO \nprocedures for the equipment or machine.  \n3. Notify their OSHA manage ment that they are requesting to lock out \nhazardous energy to conduct inspection activities .  \n4. OSHA management and the OSHA employee requesting the approval will \ndiscuss and consider all alternatives . \n \n If no alternatives are identified the applicable OSHA m anagement representative will \ndecide whether to approve using LO/TO procedures and also whether:  \n1. The requesting employee will continue with the inspection activities as an \nauthorized OSHA employee ; or  \n2. Another authorized OSHA employee  will proceed with the  inspection \nactivities.  \n Prior to using LO/TO device(s) to control hazardous energy approved by \nmanagement, the authorized OSHA employee will:  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 13-36 1. Inform the on -site employer about OSHA’s LO/TO Program including the \nprocedure for the host employer to follow if a lock is left in place after the \nOSHA employee leaves the facility.  \n2. Comply with OSHA requirements under 29 CFR 1910.147 and follow the \non-site employer’s effective LO/TO procedures.  \n3. Verify that the on -site employer’s authorized employee(s) fully de -energized \nthe equipment/machine and utilized an appropriate and effective energy \nisolating device(s) for the equipment/machine.   \n4. Place his or her lock(s) on each isolating device for the equipment as part of \na group lockout.  OSHA employees will only enter in to group lockout that \nincludes a lock placed by the on -site employer’s authorized employee.  \n5. Ensure that the on -site employer’s authorized employee verifies that the \nhazardous energy source is controlled after ensuring that personnel are not \npotentially exposed to the hazardous energy if released.  \n6.  Not attempt to activate/operate the on -site employer’s equipment.  \n7. Authorized OSHA employees applying LO/TO procedures will:  \na. Limit the time for conducting work activities that require hazardous \nenergy LO/TO to the absolute minimum needed to complete tasks.  \nb. Remove only their energy -isolating device.   \nc. Notify their responsible OSHA Manager(s) that the LO/TO procedure \nis complete when lockout devices are removed.  \n \n8. If the lockout device is unintentionally left on t he equipment after leaving the \nworksite, the on -site employer will contact the appropriate OSHA Office \nbefore removing the device.  OSHA management will contact the OSHA \nemployee to verify their location and the OSHA employee will return to the \nsite to rem ove the lock.  Where the OSHA employee cannot return to the site, \nthe OSHA employee’s responsible OSHA Manager(s) may authorize \nremoving the lockout device(s) only after the OSHA employee’s location is \nverified and the OSHA employee agrees with removing th e lockout device.  \n \nVIII.

PERMIT REQUIRED CONF INED SPACES  \nI. Purpose  \nThe objective of the Permit -Required Confined Space chapter  is to protect employees \nfrom confined space hazards during the performance of inspection activity.  \nII. Scope  \nThis program applies to all OSHA employees  who conduct inspections that include \ndetermining an employer’s  compliance with confined space standards.   OSHA prohibits \nemployees from entering into permit spaces without the written approval of the Area \nDirector/Unit Manager.    \nNormally, OSHA employees  will not be working in such a position so as to necessitate \nentering permit -required confined spaces and will only do so rarely .  If such entries \nare not absolutely required or OSHA employees  are not absolutely certain regarding \nthe safe entry into the sp ace, then those entries are not to be conducted under any \ncircumstance.  \nIII. Definitions  \n Authorized entrant.   An OSHA employee who has received written authorization to \nenter a permit confined space from their responsible OSHA Manager(s) . \n Attendant .  An indivi dual stationed outside one or more permit spaces that monitors \nthe authorized entrants and who performs all attendants’ duties as described in 29 \nCFR 1910.146.  \n Confined Space .  A space that:  \n1. Is large enough and so configured that an employee can bodily en ter and \nperform assigned work; and  \n2. Has limited or restricted means for entry or exit ( e.g. tanks, vessels, silos, \nstorage bins, hoppers, vaults, and pits are spaces that may have li mited means \nof entry); and  \n3. Is not designed for continuous employee occupanc y. \n Permit -Required Confined Space (permit space) .  A confined space that has one or \nmore of the following characteristics:  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 14-41 1. Contains or has a potential to contain a hazardous atmosphere  (as defined in \n29 CFR 1910.146(b));  or \n2. Contains a material that has the  potential for engulfing an entrant;  or \n3. Has an internal configuration such that an entrant could be trapped or \nasphyxiated by inwardly converging walls or by a floor which slopes \ndownward and tapers to a smaller cross -section; or  \n4. Contains any other recogni zed serious safety or health hazard.  \nIV. Responsibilities  \n Responsible OSHA Manager(s) is responsible for:  \n1. Ensuring that employees understand the requirements of OSHA’s Permit -\nRequired Confined Space  Entry Program and that they have the knowledge \nand skills required for the safe entry, if necessary, into permit -required \nconfined spaces . \n2. Complying with all requirements of the OSHA’s  Permit -required Confined \nSpace Entry Program . \n Employees are responsible for complying with all requirements of the OSHA’s  \nPermit -required Confined Space Entry Program .  \nV. Procedures  \n OSHA prohibits employees from entering into permit spaces without the written \napproval of the Area Director/Unit Manager.  This includes permit spaces that have \nbeen reclassified or are being entered by th e employer under alternative procedures as \nspecified in 1910.146(c)(5)(ii) and (c)(7).  The final determination of whether a \nconfined space is a permit -required confined space shall be made by the OSHA \nemployee who will be the entrant with the concurrence of their responsible OSHA \nManager(s).  If entry must take place, the guidelines below shall be employed.  \n Entry policy for OSHA employees. No entry will be permitted unless all the \nprovisions of the 1910.146 standard have been met.  Only OSHA employees who are \ntrained in confined space entry and are medically fit to wear the necessary personal \nprotective equipment may enter permit -required confined spaces.  \n OSHA employees, in coordination with their responsible OSHA Manager(s), will \nevaluate the hazards iden tified by the employer which are present in the permit -\nrequired confined space. In addition, the space will be independently evaluated by the \nemployee for any other hazards which may be present.   \n In addition to personal protective equipment typically issu ed to OSHA employees, an \nemployee who is conducting inspections involving entry into a permit -required \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 14-42 confined space will be provided with and use all personal protective equipment \nnecessary for safe entry.   A self -contained escape respirator shall be wo rn where \nconfined spaces have the potential to develop hazardous atmospheres.  \n A second trained OSHA employee will act as an attendant when the first employee \nenters the permit space. Both employees will be cross -trained in each other's duties as \nan entrant  and an attendant.   The attendant will not enter the confined space under \nany circumstance.  The attendant will monitor the activities in the confined space and \norder the entrant to evacuate if there are changes that could present a hazard.  \n A safe means of rescue will be readily available onsite.  The OSHA attendant will not \nperform rescue.   The OSHA attendant will confirm that personnel designated to \nperform rescue have been trained in accordance with 1910.146(k).  If lockout is \nnecessary to control haz ards within the confined space, the OSHA entrant will follow \nOSHA’s lockout/tagout procedures (Chapter 13).  \n The employee who will enter the confined space may use the permit entry procedures \nestablished by the employer only if all of the following conditio ns are met:  \n1. The employer has a permit required confined space entry program that \ncomplies with 1910.146.  \n2. All hazards and potential hazards have been identified   There are no \ndiscrepancies or potential discrepancies between the employer’s assessment \nof the  hazards and the assessment conducted by OSHA.  \n3. The entrant verifies all entries on the permit and assures that all hazards or \npotential hazards have been eliminated or controlled.  \n4. The entrant will not rely on the employer’s atmospheric monitoring results. \nThe entrant will also conduct atmospheric monitoring to confirm the space is \nsafe to enter.  \n A copy of the entry permit or certification will be faxed to the responsible OSHA \nManager(s) for signature.  Entry will not begin until a signed copy has been retur ned \nto the entrant. The permit must also be signed by the employer’s entry supervisor.  \n The entry permit will be terminated by the responsible OSHA Manager(s) if entry \nconditions change or when the entry has been completed.  A review of the confined \nspace e ntry program will be conducted after every confined space entry.  \n Entry permits and certifications will be considered exposure records and will be \nmaintained in accordance with 1910.1020 by the TL in the local office.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 14-43 VI. Training  \n Annual training will be conduc ted on the requirements of this chapter  to assure that \nall employees  are aware of the policy and procedures necessary for confined space \nentry.  \n Minimum  training for employees  who will be entering a permit space and the \nattendant is:  \n1. The Confined Space entry course offered by OSHA's Training Institute or  \nequivalen t. \n2. Respiratory Protection course offered by OSHA's Training Institute or \nequivalent.  \n3. Training  in the use of any personal protective equipment required for \nconfined space entry.  \n4. Introduction  to Industrial Hygiene for Safety Personnel course offered by \nOSHA's Training Institute or eq uivalent training and/or experience . \n \n  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 15-44 CHAPTER 15.  FIRST AID AND CARDIO PULMONARY RESUSCITAT ION  \nI. Purpose  \nTo provide prompt and properly administered first aid, cardiopulmonary resu scitation \n(CPR), and Automated External Defibrillation (AED) to minimize the severity of injuries \nand illnesses that may occur in the workplace.   \nII. Scope  \nThis chapter applies to all OSHA employees.  Any reference to AEDs is reserved until \nfurther notice.  \nIII. Definitions  \n Automated External Defibrillator (AED) .  A medical device that analyzes the heart \nrhythm and can deliver an electric shock to victims of ventricular  fibrillation to \nrestore the heart’s normal rhythm.  \n Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) .  The comb ination of artificial respiration and \nmanual artificial circulation.   \n First Aid .  Immediate assistance, emergency care, or treatment given to an ill or \ninjured person before regular medical aid can be obtained.   \n \n \nIV. Responsibilities  \n The responsible OSHA Ma nager(s) or his or her designee is responsible for the \ndevelopment and implementation of this program in OSHA Offices.  \n Only designated first aid responders are expected to provide first aid as part of their \njob duties.  \n In those offices where emergency services cannot respond within fifteen minutes, the \nresponsible OSHA Manager(s) or his or her designee will solicit a sufficient number \nof volunteers to administer first aid.   \n1. Where a sufficient number have not volunteered, the responsible OSHA \nManager(s)  or designee will designate individuals as first aid responders as a \ncollateral job duty.  \n2. Designees will include members outside the bargaining unit and others \nwithin the bargaining unit subject to the collective bargaining agreement.   \n The responsible OS HA Manager(s) will assure the following:  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 15-45 1. All employees are offered first aid and CPR training;  \n2. Training certificates remain current; and  \n3. The contents of first aid kits are replenished and maintained in a serviceable \ncondition.   \n Employees exposed to blood will follow the Bloodborne Pathogen Standard and \nprocedures outlined in Chapter 19 .   \nV. Procedures  \n In the event of an injury to an employee, an assessment of the injuries will be made \nby a designated first aid responder as to whether the injury requires treatment beyond \nfirst aid.  If further treatment is needed, the employee will be transported to an \nappropriate facility.  Call 911 for all transports deemed unsafe other than by \nemergency response services.   \n In the event of an injury to a contract worker, first aid supplies will be made available \nto the individual.  If the extent of an injury requires t reatment beyond first aid, \nemergency response services (911) will be contacted.   \n In the event first aid is required, it will be provided by a designated first aid \nresponder.   \n Incidents in which employees provide first aid and/or CPR in the course of thei r \nduties must be reported to the unit manager for review and follow -up, which may be \nnecessary to protect the health of the employee.   \nVI. Training  \n Training will include the means of accessing emergency response services.   \n All employees will be offered first  aid, CPR and AED training.  \n Training will be provided to maintain certifications.  \n Certificates of training will be issued to those employees who successfully complete \ntraining.  \n Training records will be retained at the office level.   \n Contents of the train ing will include those subjects listed in OSHA’s publication \n“Best Practices Guide: Fundamentals of a Workplace First Aid Program.”  Training \nmust include practice with one -way masks and special emphasis must be given to \ntreatment of heart attack and strok e victims.   \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 15-46 VII.

HEARING CONSERVATION  PROGRAM  \nI. Purpose  \nThis chapter  initiates and establishes a hearing conservation program  (HCP)  that \ncomplies with 29 CFR 1910.95  to protect OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 \nfrom the effects of occupational noise exposure. The Hearing Conservation Amendment \nto the OSHA Occupational noise exposure standard, 29 CFR 1910.95, requires that \nemployers establish a hearing conservation program for employees whose noise \nexposures equal or exceed an 8 -hour time-weighted average (TWA) of 85 dBA.  \nII. Scope  \nThis chapter establishes HCP for OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 who are \nassigned to field duties where noise exposures are anticipated to be at or above 85 \ndecibels (dBA) as an 8 -hour time -weighted ave rage (TWA).  \n \nSee OSHA Instruction, PER 04 -00-005 for information on scope of coverage of OSHA \npersonnel for the Agency's Medical Examination Program.  \nIII.

Significant Changes  \nThe program was established by OSHA Instruction PER 04 -00-005.  This chapter \nreiterate s the policies established by the Instruction, introducing no changes to the \nprogram.  \n \nVIII.  Background  \nThe Agency's Medical Program established in 1989 included audiometric testing as a \ndeterminant of eligibility for duty. At that time, it was not anticipated that OSHA \npersonnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 would experience noise exposures that warranted \nthe implementation of an HCP. However, noise survey measurements have since \ndemonstrated that OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 periodically work in \nenvironments that warrant enrollment in a HCP in accordance with the hearing \nconservation amendment to 29 CFR 1910.95 , Occupational noise exposure.  \n \nA HCP includes noise monitoring, audiometric testing, employee notification, use of \nappropriate hearing protection, administration of pertinent training and education, and \nassociated recordkeeping. Specific imp lementation protocols are delineated below in \nSection X. Procedures.  \n \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 16-50 IX. Policy  \nThis chapter establishes an OSHA HCP that is consistent with the hearing conservation \namendment to 29 CFR 1910.95 , Occupational noise exposure.  \n \nWhenever feasible, OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 are encouraged to avoid \nexposure to hazards, including noise. The personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 are to \nlimit their exposure to noise to the  minimum duration necessary, and to wear hearing \nprotection as required for the safe completion of their duties. In addition, whil e OSHA \npersonnel covered by PER 04-00-005 are at facilities in which employees are required by \ntheir employers to wear hearing  protection, OSHA personnel are to wear hearing \nprotectors that provide equivalent hearing protection to that which the facility employees \nare wearing.  \n \nX. Procedures  \n Noise Monitoring  \n \nDue to the wide variety of worksites encountered and the variability of wo rking \nconditions in each site, OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 may encounter \nperiods of noise exposure in excess of 85 dBA, as an 8 -hour TWA. Newly hired \nOSHA personnel receive orientation training that prepares them to evaluate and \nprotect themsel ves from potentially harmful noise exposures. OSHA personnel \ncovered by PER 04 -00-005 are to follow procedures in the OSHA Technical Manual \nTED 01 -00-015, Chapter 5, in order to determine the indications of potentially \nharmful workplace noise levels and the need to conduct screening noise monitoring \nusing a sound level meter (SLM). The res ults of screening measurements will be used \nby OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 to select appropriate hearing \nprotectors.  \n \nIntensity and duration of the noise exposure, in addition to professional judgment, \nmust be used in determining how best to me asure the exposure of the affected \nemployee.  (OSHA Technical Manual TED 01 -00-015:  \nhttps://www.osha.gov/enforcement/directives/ted -01-00-015-5). Also, see Section E. \nRecords Prog ram for procedures for recording and reporting noise exposure  \nmeasurements.  \n Audiometric Testing program  \nAudiometric testing will be conducted in concert with the Agency's Medical \nExamination Program. All audiometric exams performed as part of the Agency's \nMedical Examination Program must take place in an appropriate test environment \nthat does not interfere with the accuracy of the audiometric test thresholds. \nAudiometric test frequencies shall include: 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz, 2,000 Hz, 3,000 Hz, \n4,000 Hz, 6,000 H z, and 8,000 Hz. Requirements for test equipment and calibration \nmust conform, at a minimum, to the calibration and audiometric test requirements set \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 16-51 forth in the hearing conservation amendment 29 CFR1910.95(g) to the occupational \nnoise exposure standard.  \n \nPrior to receiving audiometric testing, OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 \nwill complete an audiometric history form in order to document pertinent medical \nhistory, noise exposure, and use of hearin g protection. (See Appendix A).  \n1. Scheduling . Baseline  and annual audiometric exams will be scheduled \nconcurrently with pre -placement and annual medical examinations \nrespectively. Retest audiograms will be conducted within 30 days of the time \nthat a Standard Threshold Shift (STS) is identified.  \n \n2. Baseline Audi ogram . The baseline audiogram must be preceded by a \nminimum period of 14 hours of quiet without exposure to workplace noise. \nThe use of hearing protection is an acceptable alternative to the 14 -hour quiet \nperiod before the baseline audiogram is taken. The baseline audiogram for \ncovered OSHA personnel is defined as follows:  \n \na. OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 hired prior to the \nestablishment of the 1989 Medical Examination Program will have \ntheir 1989 audiogram or their oldest qualifying audiogram on fi le \nidentified as their baseline audiogram.  \n \nb. OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 hired after 1989 will \nhave their pre -placement audiogram identified as their baseline \naudiogram. Valid baseline audiograms are obtained prior to field \nassignment as require d by the pre -employment medical requirements \nprogram (See OSHA Instruction, PER 04 -00-005). \n \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 16-52 3. Annual audiogram . Audiometric testing will be conducted annually. Each \nannual audiogram shall be compared to the baseline audiogram to validate its \naccuracy, and d etect significant changes in hearing. The 14 -hour quiet period \nis not necessary for annual audiograms.  \n4. Notification of Audiogram Results . Immediately following audiometric \ntesting, covered OSHA personnel will receive preliminary verbal feedback \non their te st results by an individual qualified to administer the audiometric \nexam. A preliminary determination of an STS will result in covered OSHA \npersonnel automatically receiving an appointment for a retest audiogram. A \ndefinitive interpretation of all audiogra ms will take place following \naudiogram review by the physician acting as the HCP Director (see Section \nXI. E.). Formal written notification letters will be sent to each employee in \nthe program from the HCP Director regarding: findings of annual audiograms \nthat do not warrant retesting, findings of retest audiograms including STS, \nindications of possible otological pathology, and recommendations for \naudiological or otological follow -up. If covered OSHA personnel receive a \nretest audiogram, he/she will receiv e a single notification letter that explains \nthe findings of both the annual and retest audiograms. (See Sample \nNotification Letter, Appendix B). The OSHA Office of Occupational \nMedicine  and Nursing  (OOM N) will contact covered OSHA personnel with \nspecific information in order for them to obtain follow -up testing and \ntreatment as needed (see section B.7.e. below).  \n5. Retest audiogram . OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 with annual \naudiograms that meet the STS criteria will be retested within 30 days of the  \nannual audiogram to determine whether the threshold shift is temporary or \npersistent. Retest audiograms should be conducted after a 14 -hour quiet \nperiod. However, hearing protection may be used as an alternative to the 14 -\nhour quiet period. A retest audio gram conducted within 30 days of the annual \naudiogram may be substituted for the annual audiogram. The retest \naudiogram may confirm a newly identified STS, or it may reveal an \nimprovement in hearing threshold. In both of these cases, the results of the \nretest audiogram can be substituted for the annual audiogram.  \n6. Revised Baseline Audiogram . An annual audiogram may be substituted for \nthe baseline audiogram when: (a) the STS is persistent; or (b) the hearing \nthreshold shown in the annual audiogram indicates s ignificant improvement \nover the baseline audiogram. The audiometric findings from each ear are \nevaluated independently for improvement or worsening of the auditory \nthreshold of the person on whom the audiogram was performed. If only one \near meets the crite ria for an STS, the baseline may be revised for that ear \nonly. Thus, future audiometric tracking will be based on separate left and \nright ear baseline revisions.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 16-53 7. Standard Threshold Shift . The criterion for STS is a change in hearing \nthreshold relative to t he baseline audiogram of an average of 10 dB or more \nat 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 Hz in either ear. Age corrections will be applied in \ndetermining STS. If an STS has occurred, the employee will be informed of \nthis fact in writing, within 21 days of the final  determination. When the HCP \nDirector (Section Xl.E.) has determined that an STS has occurred, the \nfollowing actions will take place:  \na. The HCP Director will send a notification letter to the affected \nemployee. The HCP Director will send a separate notification letter to \nthe OSHA Office of Occupational Medicine  and Nursing  (OOM N) as \nthe employer representative. The HCP Director will provide both \nnotification letters within 21 days of determining that an STS has \noccurred. If the STS did not persist on  the retest audiogram, or if there \nis an improvement in hearing thresholds, the notification letter will \nindicate these findings.  \n \nb. OOM N will notify the Regional Administrator, his/her designee, or \nDirectorate Head as appropriate, of the presence of an STS,  and of the \nrequired follow -up actions, including the need for an OSHA 300 log \nentry per paragraph X.E.4. Recording Criteria for Cases Involving \nOccupational Hearing Loss.  \n \nc. The designated Hearing Conservation Coordinator (HCC) (see Section \nXI. C.) will ens ure proper evaluation of the adequacy of hearing \nprotectors. If the affected employee is not using hearing protectors, \nthat employee shall be fitted with hearing protectors, trained in their \nuse and care, and be required to use them. If the affected employ ee is \nalready wearing hearing protectors, he/she will be refitted and \nretrained in the use of hearing protectors and be required to use them. \nAlternative hearing protectors will be provided as appropriate.  \n \nd. The HCP Director will advise OOM N of recommendati ons for \nadditional audiological or otological evaluations (See Appendix C). \nOOM N will make final determinations on appropriate referrals as \nnecessary.  \n \ne. OOM N will inform the affected employee of the purpose for \nadditional testing, the logistics for obtainin g additional testing, and of \nthe implications of test results.  \n Hearing Protection  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 16-54 Hearing protectors shall be provided at no cost to all OSHA personnel covered by \nPER 04 -00-005. They shall be fitted with hearing protectors and trained in their use \nand care . Covered OSHA personnel shall wear hearing protectors when exposed to 90 \ndBA or greater as an 8 -hour TWA. Covered personnel who have experienced an STS \nshall wear hearing protectors when exposed to sound levels of 85 dBA or greater as \nan 8-hour TWA. Dual hearing protection shall be worn if exposures exceed 105 dBA \nas an 8 -hour TWA.  \nIn addition, when OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 are at facilities in \nwhich employees are required by their employers to wear hearing protection, OSHA \npersonnel are req uired to wear hearing protection equivalent to that worn by \nemployees at the facility. See OSHA Field Operations  Manual (FOM)  CPL 02-00-\n163, Chapter 3. Inspection Procedures, 3. which states: \" Section 1903.7(c) requires \nCSHOs to comply with all employer safety and health rules and practices at the \nestablishment being inspected; CSHOs shall wear and use appropriate protective \nclothing and equipment.”  \n1. OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 will be provided the \nopportunity to choose their hearing protectors from a variety of types, with \nsuitable attenuation characteristics. Factors to consider include comfort, \ncommunication, hearing ability, compatibility wi th other personal protective \nequipment, and the environment in which they will be worn.  \n2. Training in the use and care of hearing protectors is required. Hearing \nprotectors must be properly fitted and their correct use must be demonstrated.  \n3. Hearing protector s must provide appropriate attenuation. (See 29 CFR \n1910.95 Appendix B.)  \na. Hearing protectors must attenuate noise exposure to at least 90 dBA as \nan 8-hour TWA.  \n \nb. For OSHA personnel covered by PER 04 -00-005 who have \nexperienced an STS, hearing protectors must  attenuate noise exposure \nto at least 85 dBA as an 8 -hour TWA.  \n \nc. 29 CFR 1910.95 Appendix B, should be referred to for assistance on \nhow to determine appropriate hearing protector attenuation.

Recording Criteria for Cases Involving Occupational Hearing Lo ss. (Refer to \nsection XI. for Roles and Responsibilities.) An STS must be recorded on the \nOSHA 300 log and the hearing loss column must be checked on the log when \nthe following conditions are met: an audiogram for a covered OSHA \nemployee reveals a work -related STS in hearing in one or both ears and the \nperson's total hearing level is 25 dB or more, averaged at 2000, 3000 and \n4000 Hz in the same ear(s) as the STS. The audiometric results will be age -\nadjusted (Appendix F, 29 CFR 1910.95 ). Age adjustment will not be used \nwhen determining whether the person's total hearing level is 25 dB or more \nabove audiometric zero. The OSHA Intranet provides a hearing loss \n\"decision tree\" to assist in determining whether the results of an audiometric \nexam, given on or after January 1, 2003, reveal a recordable STS. If the retest \naudiogram, conducted within 30 days of the annual audiogram, does not \nconfirm a recordable STS, the hearing loss case does not need to be recorded \non the OSHA 300 log. If the retest audiogram confirms a recordable STS, the \nhearing loss case must be recorded on the OSHA 300 log within 7 calendar \ndays of the retest. OOM N will notify the Regional Administrator, his/her \ndesignee, or Directorate Head, as appropriate, of the need to record an STS \nwithin sufficient time to satisfy this recording requirement. If the STS does \nnot persist, the recorded entry on the log may be erased or lined -out. See \nRecording criteria for case s involving occupationa l hearing loss, 29 CFR \n1904.10 . \n \nXI. Roles and Responsibilities  \n Directorate of  Technical Support and Emergency Management  \nThe Office of Occupational Medicine  and Nursing (OOMN) , in the Directorate of \nTechnical Support and Emergency Management (DTSEM ) shall maintain oversight \nof the audiometric testing portion of the HCP.

FALL PROTECTION  \n \nI. Purpose  \nThis chapter establishes the OSHA Field Safety and Health Man agement System \n(SHMS) Fall Prevention and Protection Program.  OSHA employees need to recognize \nfall hazards and know how to avoid them. If tasked to work at heights, OSHA employees \nshould understand safe procedures to work at heights and have the appropri ate level of \ntraining.  The policies and procedures in this Program are intended to set broad \nexpectations for preventing OSHA employee injury or death from falling.  OSHA expects \nRegions, DTSEM, and DTE to develop specific procedures that align with this Program \nas needed.  This Program emphasizes using accepta ble alternatives that meet the work \nrequirement without working at heights , establishes roles and responsibilities, and \ndescribes training requirements .  Chapter 11, Walking Working Surfaces provides  \nadditional information applicable to surfaces at heights.  \n \nII. Scope  \nThis Program applies to all OSHA employees covered by the OSHA Field Safety and \nHealth Manual.  All employees will take necessary precautions while conducting work \nactivities, including coll ecting information to document fall hazards in workplaces. The \nmajority of policies in this chapter are for activities that require Basic or Advanced \nClimber Training. OSHA employees that do not need Basic or Advanced Climber \nTraining to conduct work activ ities will receive awareness training and may use ladders \nat their discretion when fall protection equipment is not required.   \nIII. References  \n 29 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1926 Subpart M, Fall Protection  \n OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual, Chapter 13, Control of Hazardous Energy \nSources  \n OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual, Chapter 11, Walking and Working Surfaces  \n American Natio nal Standards Institute (ANSI)/American Society of Safety Engineers \n(ASSE) Z -359, Fall Protection Code  \n Personal Fall Protection Used in Construction and Demolition Operations, \nANSI/ASSE A10.32 -2012  \n \n \nIV. Definitions  \n Responsible OSHA Managers  are trained and competent supervisors appointed by \nRegional Administrators/Directorate Directors (RAs/Directors) to perform duties \nspecified in this Program for overseeing local implementation.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 17-65 \n Authorized OSHA Employees (Authorized Employees)  are designated by the \nResponsible OSHA Manager based on the need to conduct work activities at heights  \nrequiring fall protection (e.g. investigation and inspections).   Authorized Employees \ncomplete appropriate training and have the knowledge and expertise  to safely conduct \nwork activities  with fall protection  at anticipated heights.  Authorized Employees  will \nuse ladders at their discretion and follow Regional policy for notification to their \nsupervisor when conducting work activities that require Basic or  Advanced Climber \ntraining. Authorized Employees  designation may include OSHA trainers who teach \nfall protection courses and conduct hands -on exercises at heights.   \nAuthorized Employees  are grouped into two categories:  \n1. Basic Climbers:   This authorization level is for employees who are trained \nand equipped with the knowledge and expertise to safely work at limited \nlocations at heights (see Activities Requiring Basic Fall Prevention and \nProtection Training, Section VII.A) . Basic Climbers are not authorized t o use \nfall arrest systems.  \n2. Advanced Climbers:   Employees who volunteer and are selected, receive \nmedical clearance, and are trained and equipped with advanced  knowledge \nand expertise to safely work at heights with complexities, including towers \n(see Activ ities Requiring Advanced Climber Training Level, Section VII.A).  \n Personal Fall Protection Systems include Personal Fall Arrest Systems (PFAS), \nPersonal Fall Restraint Systems (PFRS), positioning devices, and ladder safety \ndevices or systems.  \n1. PFAS: A PFAS protects an Authorized OSHA Employee if a fall occurs by \narresting or stopping the fall. It must function to ensure that the worker \nneither free falls more than 6 feet nor contacts any lower level (see 29 CFR \n1926.502(d)(16)(iii)).  The anchor point must s upport at least 5,000 pounds \nas per attached Authorized Employee (see 29 CFR 1926.502(d)(15)).   \n2. PFRS: A PFRS will prevent an Authorized OSHA Employee from falling \nany distance.  Restraint systems used by Authorized OSHA Employees must \nhave the capacity to  withstand at least twice the maximum expected force \nthat is needed to restrain a person from exposure to the fall hazard.  In \ndetermining this force, consideration should be given to site -specific factors \nsuch as the force generated by a person walking, l eaning, or sliding down a \nworking surface.  The OSHA Technical Manual Fall Protection in \nConstruction Chapter  provides further information and PFRS examples.  \nNOTE:  Fall restrai nt is preferred over fall arrest.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 17-66 3. Positioning devices: Body belts serve as positioning devices. They can \nposition a worker so that he or she can safely perform a job in a vertical work \nposition at a height as per requirements in 29 CFR 1926.502(e),  29 CFR 1926 \nSubpart M, Appendix D .  \n4. A ladder safety device or system is used to  climb fixed ladders and includes a \ncarabiner, carrier rail, safety sleeve and body harness. It is available as a \ncable (i.e., vertical lifeline) or fixed rail system per requirements in 29 CFR \n1926.1053(a)(18),(22) , and (23) and 29 CFR 1910.27(d).   \n \nV. Responsibilities  \n RAs/Directors will:  \n1. Establish fall prevention and protection procedu res specific to the \nRegion/SLTC/CTC/DTE  and implement them in accordance with this \nProgram. These site specific procedures will include:  \na. Means for ensuring that all employees are appropriately trained.  \nb. An established process for employees to notify the Responsible OSHA \nManager about fall hazards when work activities require basic and \nadvanced training.  \nc. A mechanism for properly inspecting, maintaining, storing, and \nremoving fall protection equipment from service when it is no longer \nin good condition.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 17-67 2.

General Requirements  \n1.  Respirator  Selection  \n \nFor purposes of fit testing, employees will \nselect a respirator from the following types \noffered.    MSA Comfo Classic Half Mask APR  \no Small  \no Medium  \no Large  \n MSA Ultra -Twin Full Face APR  \no Small  \no Medium  \no Large  \n2.  Selection Alternative  \n \nIf a proper fit cannot be achieved using the \nselection offered, another make will be \nobtained.   \n 3M Particulate Mask  \n Air-supplying respiratory equipment  \n3.  Practical Demonstration  \n \nFor the benefit of the employee(s) to be \ntested the following will be demonstrated \nprior to the selection and fit test.  If needed, \nmirrors can be used to assist the employee \nin visually observing the various steps.    How to put on a respirator  \n Positioning  the respirator one one’s face  \n How to set/adjust strap tension  \n How to determine an acceptable fit  \n Selecting the proper size is key to \nproper protection  \n4.  Determining Adequacy of Respirator Fit  \n \nIf the employee finds the fit unacceptable, \nthe individual  will select a different \nrespirator and be re -tested.  \n \nAdditional testing will be performed when \nchanges in an employee’s physical \ncondition occur that could affect respirator \nfit.    Chin properly placed in chin cup  \n Adequate strap placement/tension, not \noverly tight  \n Fit across nose bridge  \n Properly sized respirator spans distance \nfrom nose to chin  \n Tendency of respirators to slip  \n Self-observation in mirror to evaluate \nfit and position  \n5.  User Seal Checks  \n \nFor purposes of donning a respirator for fit \ntestin g, each user must conduct the \nrespirator use procedures, consisting of \nboth the positive and negative pressure seal \nchecks.   \n  \n \n Seal the mask on the face by moving \nthe head from side to side and up and \ndown slowly while taking in a few slow \ndeep breaths.   \n \n \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 18-92 A.  Positive pressure check  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB.  Negative Pressure Check   Close off the exhalation valve with your \nhand while exhaling gently into the \nfacepiece.   \n A good fit will result in a slight positive \npressure building up without leakage  \n A poor fit results in outward leakage at \none or more points along the face -to-\nfacepiece seal.  \n \n Close off both cartridge inlets with the \npalm of the hands.  \n Inhale gently so the facepiece collapses \nslightly.  \n Hold breath for 10 seconds.  \nIf the respirator remains in the slightly \ncollapsed position and no inward leakage of \nair is detected, the tightness of the \nrespirator is satisfactory.   \n6.  Interference with Facepiece Seal  \n \nFacial hair must not interfere wit h the face -\nto-face seal.  Beards and beard stubble are \nnot permitted.  Sideburns and mustaches \nthat interfere with face -to-facepiece seal \nmust be shaved or trimmed.   \n7.  Fit Test Exercise Regimen  \n \nFor Qualitative and Quantitative Fit Test:  \n \nA.  Prior to e ntering the test chamber, the \ntest subject shall be given complete \ninstruction as to his/her part in the test \nprocedures.  The regimen will be performed \nin its entirety for each test conducted.  The \nrespirator must be worn for a least 5 \nminutes prior to te sting/  \n \nB.  Each test exercise will be performed for \none minute with the exception of the \ngrimace, which is 15 seconds.   \n \nC.  If the fit or comfort becomes \nunacceptable during the test, the test is \nvoided if respirator adjustments are done \nduring the test.    Normal breathing in a standing position \nwithout talking.  \n Deep breathing, slowly and deeply \nwhile standing.  \n Turning head  slowly side to side, \nhesitating at each extreme position for \nat least 5 seconds to inhale.  Stand in \nplace  \n Standing in place, the subject will \nslowly move his or her head up and \ndown.  The head will be held at each \nextreme position for at least 5 seconds.   \n Read a select passage slowly and loud \nenough to be heard.   \n Grimace by smiling or frowning.  \n(Perform only for Quantitative Test.)   \n Bend over at the waist.

Saccharine Solution Aerosol Protocol  \n \nA.  Taste Threshold Screening  \n \nThe taste threshold screening is performed \nwithout a respirator for purposes of \ndetermining the individual’s ability to \ndetect the taste of saccharine.  \n \nNote:  Eating or drinking something sweet \nbefore the screening may affect the ability \nto detect saccha rine.    Individuals must wear a #M or \nequivalent hood during screening.  \n The individual will breathe through \ntheir slightly open mouth exposing the \ntongue to the air during inhalation.  \n A 3M nebulizer or equivalent will be \nused to produce the aerosol.  \n Thres hold check Solution A must be \nused for this screening.  Do not use \nSolution B.   \n Firmly squeezes the nebulizer bulb 10 \ntimes with the nozzle inserted into the \nhold in the front of the hood.  \n If the individual indicates that they have \ndetected the sweet sacc harine taste, the \nscreening test is completed.  \n If the individual does not detect the \nsweet taste, introduce an additional 10 \nsqueezes of aerosol into the hood.  \n Repeat this in increments of 10 \nsqueezes until the individual can detect \nthe saccharine.   \n Document on the fit test report the \nnumber of squeezes introduced into the \nhood.  \n \nIf after 30 squeezes the individual has not \ndetected the saccharine taste, the individual \nis considered unable to detect saccharine \nand cannot be fit tested using this metho d. \n2.  Saccharin Solution Aerosol Protocol  \n \nB.  Saccharine Solution Aerosol Fit Test \nProcedures  \n Individuals to be tested may not eat, drink \n(except water), smoke, or chew gum for 15 \nminutes before the test.  \n \nThe 3M hood enclosure is used for this test.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 18-94 For use in fit testing the 3M \nDust/Particulate Mask   \n The individual to be tested will properly \ndon the respirator.  \n Place the hood over the individual’s \nhead.  \n A separate nebulizer identified for fit \ntesting, other that the one used for the \nscreening test, will be used.  \n The nebulizer is filled with fit test \nSolution B.  \n Instruct the individual to breathe  \nthrough the slightly opened mouth and \nreport if the sweet taste of saccharine is \ndetected.  \n With the individual fitted in their \nrespirator, in the hood,  introduce \naerosol by squeezing the nebulizer bulb \n10 times.  \n Perform the fit test exercise regimen \n(Section A -8) above.  \n Replenish the aerosol concentration \nevery 30 seconds during the exercise by \nsqueezing the nebulizer 5 times.  \n The individual being teste d must report \nany time during the test if saccharine is \ndetected.  \n If the taste of saccharine is detected, the \ntest is voided and must be repeated \nusing a different respirator.  The entire \nprotocol must be repeated.  \n3.  Irritant Smoke (Stannic Chloride) \nProtocol  \n \nUse for fit testing the following respirators:  \nHalf-mask respirators  \nFull-face cartridge respirators   \nA.  General Requirement and Precautions   During the test, the respirator will be \nequipped with high efficiency \nparticulate (HEPA) or P100 series \nfilters.  \n Only stannic chloride smoke tubes will \nbe used.  \n Exercise caution when using an irritant.  \n Perform tests in a well ventilated area.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 18-95 B.  Irritant Smoke Sensitivity Screening \nCheck   The person being tested must \ndemonstrate their ability to detect a \nweak concentration of irritant smoke.   \n The individual performing the test will \nadvise the individual being tested that \nthe smoke can be mildly irritating to \neyes and respiratory tract.   \n Using an aspirator bulb attached to a \nsmoke tube, introduce a weak \nconcentration of smoke in the direction \nof the individual being tested.  \n Document on the Fit Test Report the \nindividual’s ability to detect the smoke.  \nC.  Irritant Smoke Fit Test Procedure   The individual to be tested will don the \nrespirator without assistance.  \n Each individual will perform the \nrequired user seal tests (Reference A -6). \n As a precaution, individuals are to keep \neyes closed.  \n Beginning at 12 inches and then at 6 \ninches, the test  will make 3 passes \naround the entire seal area, directing the \nsmoke toward the face -seal area.  \n At a distance of 6 inches, direct smoke \naround the face -seal and initiate the fit \ntest exercise regiment ( Reference A -8). \n During the fit test, any detection of \nsmoke by the individual being tested \nconstitutes a failed test.  \n Re-tests require that the entire protocol \nbe repeated.  \n Passing the fit tests without evidence of \na response to the irritant smoke will \nrequire the individual to complete a \nsecond sensitivity s creening check.  \nFit Testing Procedures  \nC.

BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS  \nI. Purpose  \nThis program establishes a uniform policy and guidelines for protecting OSHA \nemployees from bloodborne pathogens and other potentially infectious materials (OPIM).  \nII. Scope  \nThis program applies to all staff of the OSHA’s Field offices. OSHA does not anticipate \nits employees will have occupational exp osure to blood or OPIM.  \nIII. References  \n CPL 02 -02-077, Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan and Guidance on \nPost-Exposure Evaluations for Federal OSHA Personnel, dated 09/27/2010.  \n Memorandum of Understanding Between The U.S. DOL and NCFLL, dated \n10/21/2010 . \nIV. Exposure Control Plan  \n Exposure Determination.  \nOSHA does not anticipate that its employees will have occupational exposure to \nblood or other potential infectious materials (OPIM). OPIM is defined as: (1) The \nfollowing human body fluids: semen, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial \nfluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, saliva in dental \nprocedures,  any body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood, and all body \nfluids in situations where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between body \nfluids; (2) Any unfixed tissue or organ (other than intact skin) from a human (living \nor dead); and  (3) HIV -containing cell or tissue cultures, organ cultures, and HIV - or \nHBV -containing culture medium or other solutions; and blood, organs, or other \ntissues from experimental animals infected with HIV or HBV. The standard defines \noccupational exposure as  “reasonably anticipated skin, eye, mucous, membrane or \nparental contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that may result \nfrom performance of the employee’s duties.”  \nCSHOs and other field personnel conduct investigations at sites where blood and \nOPIM are present. However, OSHA does not reasonably anticipate that these \nemployees’ routine tasks will result in contact with blood or OPIM.  \n Hazard Assessment  \nCSHOs and other personnel with field duties (hereafter referred to collectively as \n“field personnel”) shall take necessary precautions to avoid contact with blood and \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 19-101 OPIM and shall not participate in activities, nor enter areas that will require them to \ncome into contact with blood or OPIM or with needles, instruments or surfaces that \nare contaminated with blood or OPIM. If field personnel believe that the investigation \nmay result in a potential exposure to blood or OPIM, they must contact their \nsupervisor immediately upon making this determination. The supervisor will contact \nthe Area Dir ector who, in turn, will contact the Regional Administrator (or designee) \nto discuss the situation. Field personnel will not enter an area where potential \nexposure to blood or OPIM could occur without prior approval from the Regional \nAdministrator (or desi gnee). In those exceptional circumstances where an exposure \nincident does occur as part of an investigation (e.g. a CSHO inadvertently handles \nitems that have become contaminated with blood or OPIM), the employee shall \nimmediately decontaminate the affecte d area following the procedures in section \nV.A.1., and then contact a supervisor to discuss the situation and how to obtain the \npost-exposure evaluation.  \n Methods of Implementation and Control  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 19-102 1. Universal Precautions and Work Practices. Field personnel should  consider \nall blood and OPIM to be infectious for HIV, HBV, and other bloodborne \npathogens. Under circumstances where differentiation of body fluid types is \ndifficult or impossible, all body fluids should be considered to be potentially \ninfectious material s.  \nField personnel are not to handle or touch objects that are contaminated, as \ndefined by 29 CFR 1910.1030(b). They shall not reach into or otherwise \nplace any parts of their bodies into the trash can or laundry bag where \nregulated waste or contaminated laundry as defined by 29 CFR 1910.1030(b) \nmay be present.  \n2. Bloodborne Pathogen Training. OSHA field personnel will be given \nbloodborne pathogen training at the time of initial assignment to field duties \nand annually on the elements included on 29 CFR 1910. 1030(g)(2) except for \n1910.1030(g)(2)(vii)(I). The training required by 1910.1030(g)(2)(vii)(I) on \nthe hepatitis B vaccine need only include information on its efficacy, safety, \nmethod of administration and the benefits of being vaccinated. The trainer \nmust be familiar with the Bloodborne pathogens standard. The Regional \nAdministrator and Area Directors who supervise employees with field duties \nare responsible for ensuring that this training is provided.  \n3. Voluntary Hepatitis B Vaccination. Firm management co mmitment to avoid \ncontact with blood and other potentially infectious materials is the primary \ncontrol method to prevent exposing field personnel to Hepatitis B and other \nbloodborne pathogens.  In addition, Hepatitis B immunization is a safe and \neffective way to prevent Hepatitis B infection and its serious consequences.  \nOSHA will provide interested field personnel with Hepatitis B immunization, \non a voluntary basis, for health promotion and preventive care in accordance \nwith the Memorandum of Understandin g between OSHA and NCFLL dated \nOctober 21, 2010.   \nHepatitis B vaccination is available to Department of Labor (DOL) \nemployees through the DOL national health services agreement with Federal \nOccupational Health (FOH).  Employees are encouraged to seek thei r \nphysician or other qualified health care provider’s advice for any questions \nregarding their medical condition(s) and also review the Center for Disease \nControl (CDC) Hepatitis B Vaccination Information Statement before \nrequesting the vaccination.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 19-103 Employ ees interested in receiving Hepatitis B vaccination should contact \ntheir local FOH unit.  It is important to make arrangements before arriving \nfor an appointment since most FOH units do not keep Hepatitis B vaccine in \nstock.  To get the Hepatitis B vaccina tion, employees must present their valid \nDOL Identification Badge at the FOH unit.  After the first Hepatitis B \nvaccination is given, the FOH unit will inform employees when to schedule \nappointments for the second and third injections to complete the vacci ne \nseries.  \nAlternatively, interested OSHA personnel that are covered by OSHA’s Field \nSHMS (e. g. in the NCFLL bargaining unit) but do not have an FOH unit in \ntheir local area may contact their Regional Office of Administrative \nPrograms to learn how to obtai n the vaccine from a local private healthcare \nprovider.  Not all healthcare providers offer Hepatitis B vaccinations and \naccept credit card payments. The Regional Office of Administrative \nPrograms can arrange with the private healthcare provider’s office t o pay for \nthe three injections necessary to complete the Hepatitis B vaccination using \nthe Regional Office’s credit card.   \nFor additional information about the Hepatitis B Vaccination please see the \nCenter for Disease Control Guidance at: \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis -statements/hep -b.html  \n4. Post-exposure Evaluation and Follow -up. OSHA shall provide post -exposure \nevaluation and follow -up, and post -exposure prophylaxis whe n medically \nindicated to any employee who suffers an exposure incident as defined by 29 \nCFR 1910.1030(b), while performing work assignments. All medical \nevaluations and procedures are to be made available at no cost to OSHA \npersonnel at a reasonable time a nd place, and under the other conditions set \nforth in 29 CFR 1910.1030(f). Post -exposure evaluation and follow -up will \nbe offered by OSHA to employees who experience an exposure to blood or \nOPIM (as defined in 29 CFR 1910.1030) while on duty when acting as  a \nGood Samaritan to others who have sustained a laceration, a nosebleed, or \nsimilar incidents.  \n5. Recordkeeping: Training Records. Training records are to contain all \ninformation specified on 29 CFR 1910.1030(h)(2) and will be maintained for \n3 years from the  date on which the training occurred. Training records will be \nheld by the office at which training took place.   \nV. Procedures for Unforeseen Contact with Blood or Other Potentially Infectious \nMaterial (OPIM)  \n Work Practice Controls  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 19-104 1. Intact skin contact with b lood or OPIM  \nEmployees are to wash their hands and any other affected skin with soap and \nwater immediately or as soon as feasible if there has been skin contact with \nblood or OPIM.    As soon as possible, the employee must notify his/her \nsupervisor regardi ng the exposure. If the OSHA employee and supervisor are \nnot able to determine the exposure was definitely not an exposure incident \n(e.g. the employee has an open wound, chapped hands), the supervisor \nshould immediately contact the Regional Administrator o r their designee.  \nThe Regional Administrator or their designee will then contact the Director \nof the Office of Occupational Medicine  and Nursing  (OOM N) within 30 \nminutes to determine if post -exposure evaluation is warranted. Each Region \nand Office will de velop procedures for notification and payment during and \nafter business hours.  \nAntiseptic towelettes will be provided by the Regional Offices to field \npersonnel. These towelettes are to be carried on all inspections, in the event \nsoap and running water may not be immediately available, and used in the \nunlikely event that contact of a ny skin surface with blood or other potentially \ninfectious material occurs. Whenever antiseptic towelettes are used, hands or \nother skin surfaces are to be washed as soon as feasible with soap and \nrunning water.   \nUsed antiseptic towelettes should be dispo sed of as non -regulated trash \nexcept in a very rare circumstance where they become contaminated to the \nextent (see 1910.1030(b)) that they would be considered regulated waste.  \n2. Contaminated equipment  \nIn the event that equipment becomes contaminated with blo od or OPIM, the \nemployee shall immediately contact a supervisor to review how to proceed in \nthis situation. Gloves and/or other appropriate barriers shall be used if \ncontaminated equipment must be handled or transported to the nearest \nRegional/Area Office or other OSHA facility. Prior to transport, a biohazard \nlabel is to be attached to any contaminated equipment and is to state which \nparts are or remain contaminated. If the biohazard label on the equipment is \nnot visible through the bag (e.g. bag is not tr ansparent), another biohazard \nlabel should be attached to the bag’s exterior.  \nThe equipment shall be examined at the nearest Regional/Area Office or \nother OSHA facility (e.g. Salt Lake Technical Center) prior to servicing or \nshipping and decontaminated (e .g. wiped with a bleach solution or other \ndisinfectant, as determined by the Office Director) as necessary. The ARA \nfor Enforcement Programs or the on -site Area Director will determine how \nand if the equipment can be decontaminated at the Office level. \nContaminated items are not to be placed or stored in areas where food is \nkept, and decontamination should be accomplished as soon as possible \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 19-105 following the inspection or incident where contamination occurred. \nDecontamination is not to take place in any area w here food or drink is \nconsumed. Cloths used to wipe contaminated equipment can be discarded as \nnon-regulated refuse unless they somehow become contaminated to the \nextent that they would be considered regulated waste as defined in 29 CFR \n1910.1030(b).  \nThe employee who is shipping equipment that remains contaminated shall \nnotify the receiving servicing center or manufacturer that contaminated \nequipment is being sent so that the receiving facility can take proper \nprecautions. In addition, this employee should  contact the package delivery \ncompany regarding appropriate packaging of the item(s).  \n Personal Protective Equipment  \nField personnel are expected to avoid contact with blood and OPIM as well as contact \nwith surfaces and items contaminated with such material s. In the unlikely event that \nequipment becomes contaminated, OSHA will provide appropriate gloves of proper \nsize (see Appendix B). Field personnel will carry these gloves on inspections. Gloves \nare to be replaced as soon as practical if they become contam inated or as soon as \nfeasible if they are torn, punctured or whenever their ability to function as a barrier \nappears to be compromised. These gloves are not to be washed or decontaminated for \nreuse.  \nField personnel are to determine the extent of contamina tion of gloves prior to their \nremoval. It is unlikely that gloves worn by field personnel would be contaminated to \nthe extent that they would be considered regulated waste, but if this should occur, the \ngloves are to be discarded in a regulated waste conta iner at the inspection site. In a \nfacility not in compliance with 29 CFR 1910.1030 regarding regulated waste, see \nsection 4.0.C.  \nIt is anticipated that field personnel will not need personal protective equipment \n(PPE) other than gloves. It is expected that  field personnel will avoid situations in \nwhich any other PPE would be needed.  \n Regulated Waste  \nOSHA does not anticipate that the duties of OSHA employees will generate regulated \nwaste.  \n Post-exposure Evaluation and Follow -up \nOSHA shall provide post -exposure  evaluation, follow -up and post -exposure \nprophylaxis, when medically indicated, to any employee who suffers an exposure \nincident while performing their work assignments. All medical evaluations and \nprocedures are to be made available at no cost to OSHA per sonnel, at a reasonable \ntime and place, and under the other conditions set forth in 29 CFR 1910.1030(f).  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 19-106 1. Handling an Exposure Incident  \nIn the unlikely event of an exposure incident (as defined in 29 CFR \n1910.1030(b)), the OSHA employee is to immediately, o r as soon as feasible, \nwash the affected skin with soap and water and flush any affected mucous \nmembranes with water. The employee should then seek medical attention. A \nbloodborne pathogens exposure incident is an event for which immediate \nattention must b e sought because the effectiveness of post -exposure \nprophylaxis is dependent on prompt administration (i.e., within hours of the \nexposure incident). An employee who has had an exposure incident is to \nreport the incident to his or her supervisor as soon as possible.  \nThe Area Director/Office Director or designee shall instruct the employee to \nseek medical attention from a healthcare provider capable of performing a \npost-exposure evaluation, and, if indicated, able to provide the hepatitis B \nvaccination series , baseline testing for hepatitis B and C and HIV, \nprophylaxis for hepatitis and HIV, and any future testing or prophylaxis as \nrecommended by the U.S. Public Health Service. Ideally, this evaluation will \nbe performed by a healthcare provider with whom an ar rangement has been \npre-established. If the employee is in the field and far from a pre -established \nhealthcare provider, the supervisor shall instruct the employee to go to the \nnearest emergency room in the area. Another healthcare provider, such as an \noccu pational medicine clinic, may be used if it can be determined that the \nprovider is capable of giving the necessary evaluation, treatment and \nprophylaxis without undue delay. Not all healthcare providers are familiar \nwith the U.S. Public Health Service Guid elines or keep hepatitis B vaccine, \nhepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) or medications for HIV post -exposure \nprophylaxis onsite. Hospital emergency rooms are more likely than other \nhealthcare providers to be capable of providing a post -exposure evaluation \nand are more likely to have Hepatitis B vaccine, Hepatitis B Immune \nglobulin and HIV post -exposure prophylaxis medications readily available. \nPlease note that the Federal Occupational Health centers do not offer post -\nexposure evaluation.  \n \nThe supervisor wi ll inform the Area Director/Office Director or designee \nwho will contact the facility where the exposure incident occurred. The area \nDirector/Office Director or designee is to work together with the facility, \nwith the assistance of the director of OOM N if needed, to ascertain the \nsource individual, and communicate that information to the healthcare \nfacility evaluating the OSHA employee. The Area Director must also contact \nthe ARA -AP and the Regional Administrator to inform them of the incident.  \n \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 19-107 Following a n exposure incident, an Exposure Incident Report (see Appendix \nA) will be completed by the OSHA employee in consultation with the \nsupervisor without delay. The report is to be given by the employee to the \nevaluating healthcare provider. Report information will include (a) a \ndescription of the exposed employee’s duties as related to the exposure \nincident; and (b) documentation of route(s) of exposure and circumstances \nunder which exposure occurred. (The supervisor may need to complete and \nsend this form by f acsimile to the evaluating healthcare facility if the \nemployee does not have the form with him or her in the field. This will help \nto assure timely sharing of information and allows the employee to travel \ndirectly from the field to the healthcare facility,  avoiding a delay in obtaining \nthe post -exposure evaluation.  \n2. Information Provided to the Evaluating Healthcare Provider  \nIn accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1030, the supervisor will see that the health \ncare facility that is performing the employee’s post -exposu re evaluation is \nprovided with a copy of 29 CFR 1910.1030 and the other materials for the \nEvaluating Healthcare Provider included in Appendix A of this program. \nThese materials may be hand -carried by the employee and/or supervisor or \nsent by facsimile. Alt ernately, supervisors may require employees to carry \nthese materials with them when they are in the field.  \nThe instructions for the healthcare provider describe the applicable \nrequirements of 29 CFR 1910.1030(f) and instruct the healthcare provider to \ngive a written opinion to the employee. The supervisor must obtain the \nwritten opinion from the employee when the employee returns to the duty \nstation. The written opinion will be maintained at the employee’s assigned \nduty station.  \nWhile at the evaluating healthcare facility, the employee should ask to sign a \nmedical records release form requesting that the healthcare provider send a \ncopy of the medical record of the evaluation to the OSHA’s Office of \nOccupational Medicine  and Nursing . This medical document ation will \nbecome a part of the employee’s confidential employee medical record \nmaintained in the Office of Occupational Medicine  and Nursing . \n Communication of Hazard to Employees  \nLabels and Bags  \nOSHA will provide biohazard labels to be affixed to bags con taining any \ncontaminated equipment until they can be returned to an OSHA office or shipped to \nanother facility. Biohazard labels are to be carried by all field personnel. OSHA will \nprovide appropriate bags for containment of any regulated waste or contamin ated \nequipment. Bags are to be carried by all field personnel. In addition, a bag and \nbiohazard labels will be provided in any First -Aid kit. Bags will be disposed of as \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 19-108 ordinary refuse except in the rare instance in which they are contaminated to the \nextent that they are considered regulated waste as defined by the standard. In such \ncase, see Section 4.0.C. of this program.  \n Recordkeeping: Post -Exposure Records  \n1. Employee Medical Records  \nEmployee medical records are to be maintained by the Office of \nOccupati onal Medicine as part of the medical files of the CSHO Medical \nExamination Program. Such records are maintained in accordance with 29 \nCFR 1910.1020 . \n2. Transfer of Record s \nOSHA will comply with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1020(h) involving \nany transfer of records. Exposure incident records will remain at the office \nwhere the employee was assigned when the incident occurred, with a copy \nsent to the Office of Occupationa l Medicine. The employee may request and \nreceive a copy of such records when transferring to another assignment.  \nVI. Procedures for Evaluating an Exposure Incident  \nThe Area Director, or a designee from the Area Office or the Office Director to whom the \naffecte d employee is assigned, will evaluate the circumstances surrounding any exposure \nincident. The evaluation should consist of at least:  \n A review of the Exposure Incident Report completed by the OSHA employee;  \n Documentation regarding a plan to reduce the like lihood of a future similar exposure \nincident; and  \n Notification of the Office of Occupational Medicine and discussion of any similar \nincidents and planned precautions.  \nManagement will ensure that employee medical records and all other personally \nidentifiabl e information is afforded all safeguards in accordance with the applicable \nprovisions of DLMS -5 Chapter 200 “The Privacy Act of 1974 and Invasion of Privacy” \nand DLMS -9 Chapter 1200 Safeguarding Sensitive Data Including Personally identifiable \nInformation.  \nSuch reports will be maintained at the employee’s assigned duty station, and copies are to \nbe sent to the Office of Occupational Medicine  and Nursing  (OOM N) and to the Regional \nAdministrator. OOM N will review these reports on a periodic basis so that this  \ninformation can be considered when reviewing and updating this Plan.    \n \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 19-109 VII. Responsibilities  \n Offices  \nOffice directors will:  \n1. Ensure that employees are trained and that training records are maintained in \naccordance with section III, paragraph A.4.5.  \n2. Determine how and if contaminated equipment can be decontaminated at the \noffice level.  \n3. Provide gloves and other supplies (e.g. bags) to field personnel.  \n4. Arrange for appropriate disposal of regulated waste if an employee is unable \nto properly dispose of it  on-site and is therefore obligated to bring it back to \nthe office for disposal.  \n5. Instruct employees to obtain post -exposure evaluation and locate an \nappropriate healthcare facility for the evaluation in the event that an exposure \nincident occurs.  \n6. Work with  the employee to complete an exposure incident report in the event \nof an exposure incident.  \n7. Ensure that the healthcare provider for any exposure incident is provided \nwith a copy of 29 CFR 1910.1030 and the other materials in Appendix A of \nthis Instruction.  \n8. Obtain a written report completed by the healthcare provider who performs a \npost-exposure evaluation on an employee.  \n9. Evaluate the Exposure Incident Report and other reports and send copies of \nthese reports to OOM N and the Regional Administrator.  \n10. Immediate ly notify the Regional Administrator, or designee, and the ARA -\nAP of any exposure incident that occurs to an employee.  \n11. Immediately notify the Regional Administrator when an employee reports \nthat an on -site investigation could result in a potential exposure  to blood or \nOPIM.  \n Employees  \nEmployees will:  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 19-110 1.

Assess areas for electrical hazards when conducting work activities at \nanother employer’s worksite.  \n2. Inspect locations where a disaste r has occurred for fallen or damaged \nenergized lines and circuits (e.g. due to fires, explosions, natural causes).  \nLines and circuits are considered energized until lockout/tagout is applied, or \nequipment is deenergized and grounded, in accordance with 29  CFR \n1910.147, 29 CFR 1910. 333(b), 29 CFR 1910.269,  and 29 CFR Part 1926 \nSubpart K, 29 CFR Part 1926 Subpart V (as applicable), and OSHA SHMS \nManual Chapter 13, Control of Hazardous Energy Sources..  \n3. Stop work and immediately contact the Responsible OSHA Manager for \ndirection when electrical hazards are identified and proper controls are not in \nplace.  \n4. Unqualified Persons will not approach uninsulated and/or unguarded sources \nor open electrical panels, covers, doors, etc., until lockout/tagout is applied, \nor equipment is deenergized and grounded, in accordance with 29 CFR \n1910.147, 29 CFR 1910. 333(b), 29 CFR 1910.269, 29 CFR Part 1926 \nSubpart K, 29 CFR Part 1926 Subpart V 29 CFR 1926.960 (as applicable), \nand OSHA SHMS Manual Chapter 13, Control of Hazardous  Energy \nSources.  \n Approach Determination Procedures for OSHA Qualified Persons at \nInspection/Investigation Worksites  \n1. Where the employer has made a determination and established an arc flash \nboundary based on an arc flash hazard analysis, the OSHA Qualified Person \nwill discuss the employer’s determinations with the Responsible OSHA \nManager prior to proceeding with an inspection involving exposed energized \nparts.  \n2. If the employer has not performed arc flash hazard analyses or established \narc flash boundaries, p rior to proceeding, the OSHA Qualified Person and \nResponsible OSHA Manager will together:  \ni. Consult a qualified engineer to help determine the \nappropriate protection level for relevant arc flash hazards.  \nOR \n \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 22-129 ii. Consult the most current NFPA 70E tables to help \ndetermine the appropriate protection level for relevant arc \nflash hazards.  \niii. Consult 29 CFR 1910.269 , Appendix E or 29 CFR 1926 \nSubpart V , Appendix E tables (as applicable) to help \ndetermine the appropriate protection level for relevant arc \nflash hazards.  \n3. When an OSHA Qualified Person agrees to work within the arc flash \nboundary, he /she will wear protective clothing and other PPE as described in \nAppendix A to protect all body parts inside the arc flash boundary.  \nNote: The prohibited approach boundary was deleted from NFPA 70E because the requirement \nfor using shock protective equipme nt typically begins at the restricted approach boundary. See \nFigure C.1.2.3. in NFPA 70E for a helpful diagram on Limits of Approach.   \nAs the distance between a person and exposed energized conductors or circuit parts decreases, \nthe potential for an elect rical incident increases.  \n Appropriate Testing Equipment Determination  \n1. Unqualified Persons may not take direct contact measurements from \nuninsulated energized parts (e. g. multi -meter).  \n2. All electrical testing equipment requires some level of training (e.g. on the \njob training) and approval for use. Some equipment requires OSHA \nQualified Persons training.

The Responsible OSHA Manager will ensure that the OSHA Qualified \nPerson has completed courses required per ap plicable compliance directives \nto safely perform assigned tasks and address associated electrical hazards.  \nExample: In the course of inspecting electrical hazards, OSHA Qualified Persons \nmay encounter enclosed or confined spaces during an inspection.  Enc losed \nspaces such as vaults or substations are by definition permit -required confined \nspaces, and OSHA Qualified Persons must treat them as such.  OSHA Qualified \nPersons may not enter such spaces on a routine basis.  When it is essential, they \nmust adhere to OSHA CPL 02 -00-100, Application of the Permit Required \nConfined Spaces Standards, 29 CFR 1910.146.  \n3. Retraining will occur: (1) when tasks are performed less than once per year; \nor (2) when the Responsible OSHA Manager (a) determines the OSHA \nQualified Pe rson does not possess adequate understanding and skill to \nperform work safely, or (b) identifies other needs for retraining.  \n Minimum Training for Unqualified Persons: Unqualified Persons will receive Annual \nSHMS Electrical Safety Awareness training and tr aining on how to identify hazards \nand perform work near energized and deenergized electrical equipment operating or \ntypically operated at 50 or more volts, for example, take photographs from a distance \n(see Table 1: Procedures for Common Electrical Tasks).  On the job training is \nnecessary before using basic electrical tools (e.g. low voltage non -contact testers, \nthree light circuit analyzers).  \n Annual SHMS Electrical Safety Awareness Training: This training will cover how to \nrecognize and avoid electrical ha zards; the requirements, restrictions, and permissions \nin this Program; and any specific electrical safety procedures implemented by the \nRegion/SLTC/CTC/DTE.  All employees covered by the OSHA Field Safety and \nHealth Manual will receive Annual SHMS Electri cal Safety Awareness Training.  \nOSHA Qualified Persons and Unqualified Persons will complete the Annual SHMS \nElectrical Safety Awareness Training as a refresher.  \n Retraining for Unqualified Persons and other OSHA employees covered by the \nOSHA Field Safety a nd Health Manual who are not OSHA Qualified Persons will \noccur whenever the Responsible OSHA Manager determines that an employee does \nnot possess adequate understanding and skill to work safely or identifies other needs \nfor retraining.  \n Training Documentati on: Written records will include the training source, training \ndescription, trained OSHA employee names, and the training dates.  All training \nrecords will be maintained in the applicable OSHA Office.  \nAPPENDIX A  \nPROTECTIVE CLOTHING AND PERSONAL PROTECT IVE EQUIPMENT (PPE)  \nPlease see the following NFPA 70E tables to indentify appropriate PPE for the specific task:  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 22-134  \n 130.7(C)(15)(a): Arc -Flash Hazard PPE Categories for Alternating Current (AC) Systems  \n 130.7(C)(15)(b): Arc -Flash Hazard PPE Categories for Direct  Current (DC) Systems  \n 130.7(C)(15)(c): PPE  \nAccess to the Standard is available on our shared drive: O: \\DTSEM \\TDC \\Standards \\N\\NFPA - \nNatl Fire Protection Assn.

PROTECTION DURING IN CIDENT INVESTIGATION  \nI. Purpose  \nOSHA personnel are not first responders.  Normally, OSHA provides only technical \nassistance and information during the active stages of response and mitigation.  Chemical \nreleases, fire,  explosions, collapses, and other events have an immediate and potentially \nlong-term affect not only to the workers involved, but also to those entities responding to \nor investigating the incident.  This includes OSHA employees.  No evidence or \ninvestigati on is of such importance that OSHA employees should endanger themselves or \nothers in the course of OSHA’s work.  \nII. Scope  \nThis procedure serves as a guideline for protecting OSHA employees during \nincident/accident investigations.   \nIII. Definitions  \n Hot zone.  The i ncident area at a site where there is or may be the presence of \nhazardous materials that can or could pose a serious hazard to an employee if it is \nentered without appropriate personal protective devices.   \n Mitigation.  Using any device, method, or system to lessen the hazard to an employee \nat an incident.   \n Special Hazard Investigation.  Investigations that include the need to utilize SCBAs \nor other uniquely personal protective equipment.   \nIV. Responsibilities  \n Responsible OSHA Manager(s) will ensure that:  \n1. Emp loyees responding to incidents are trained and qualified in the necessary \nprocedures and directives.   \n2. Employees are familiar with this procedure.  \n3. There is coordination with the Region, the Health Response Team, and the \nNational Office.  \n The investigating employee will make sure that appropriate personal protective \nequipment and monitoring equipment are brought to the scene and are in proper \nworking order.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 23-136 V. Procedures  \n When investigating an incident or accident:  \n1. Report to the On Scene Incident Commander, when one exists, before \nentering the site;  \n2. Determine what site assessments, if any, have been made and if any \nmitigation has taken place;   \n3. In conjunction with the Incident Command System, identify “hot” zones th at \nmay be present;  \n4. DO NOT enter any “hot” zone without appropriate personal protective \nequipment and monitors;  \n5. Establish evidence protocols and security with appropriate parties;  \n6. DO NOT under any circumstances enter or access any structure or equipment \nwhose structural integrity or safety may have been compromised or is in \nquestion.  A structural engineer must be consulted, and the area and/or \nequipment secured before entry or access is made;  \n7. Keep open communication with the Responsible OSHA Manager(s) a nd \nprovide sufficient detail in keeping them appraised of developing situations;  \n8. Direct media inquiries to the Responsible OSHA Manager(s); and  \n9. Maintain sufficient safe distance until the “All Clear” is given.  \n Assistance or Expertise  \n1. If assistance or ex pertise is needed, contact the Responsible OSHA \nManager(s) and identify the necessity.  \n2. The Responsible OSHA Manager(s) will coordinate with the Assistant \nRegional Administrator for Enforcement Programs or equivalent unit for \nspecific equipment and expertis e, such as the Health Response Team, \nstructural engineers, and chemical engineers.  \n Training  \nAll employees who could be involved in incident investigations will receive training \non this chapter annually.  \n  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 24-137 CHAPTER 24.  EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE  \nI. Purpose  \nThrough the Department  of Labor, OSHA employees have access to the Employee \nAssistance Program (EAP).  The EAP provides confidential counseling assessment and \nreferral services.  The EAP is designed to help employees deal with any personal or \nfamily problems that could interfer e with an employee’s performance and/or conduct at \nwork, including marriage, stress, finances, or job -related problems and concerns.   \nThe EAP is free, voluntary, and confidential.  No penalty is imposed upon an employee \nfor accepting or declining to parti cipate in the program.  The fundamental purpose of the \nEAP is to enable employees to achieve their full individual potential, even when stress \nand problems present difficult challenges in their work environment or personal life.  \nII. Scope  \nThis chapter applies to all federal OSHA employees.  \nIII. Definition  \nThe Employee Assistance Program (EAP) provides counseling services to employees \nwho may be experiencing personal problems that affect their job performance and well -\nbeing.  The main goal of the EAP is to link a tro ubled employee with people in the \ncommunity who can help that individual.     \nThe services provided by EAP are listed in the brochure describing the program and are \navailable in each office.  \nThe EAP is confidential.  If an employee refers him or herself, n o one knows but the \nemployee and the EAP counselor.  \nThe EAP also offers consultation to supervisors to assist them in dealing with employees \nwho may be experiencing problems.  \nIV. Responsibilities  \n Responsible OSHA Manager(s)  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 24-138 1. Maintain current knowledge and awar eness of the EAP and the process used \nfor accessing EAP services.  Seek consultation from the EAP, as appropriate, \nfor assistance in identifying and approaching troubled employees, providing \neffective employee feedback, and/or referring employees to the pr ogram.   \n2. Encourage and support employee participation in the EAP when an employee \nmay be experiencing personal problems and impacting the work \nenvironment.   \n3. Respect and safeguard the confidentiality of any information provided by the \nemployee or counselor . \n4. Recognize the potential need for EAP services where employees are involved \nwith investigations wherein traumatic events or injuries are involved. As \nsoon as possible after such an event, advise the affected employee(s) of the \navailability of EAP services .   \n Administrative Programs or equivalent unit  \n1. Coordinate and provide EAP services for OSHA employees.  \n2. Promote awareness of EAP services among OSHA employees.  \n3. Disseminate information on the procedures to access EAP services to OSHA \nemployees.  \n Employee  \nVoluntarily seek counseling, referral, and information from the EAP, regardless of \ncurrent level of job performance, if he or she is experiencing a personal, emotional, \ndrug abuse, or alcohol abuse problem.  All information is confidential.  \nV. Procedures  \n For counseling assistance, any OSHA employee can contact the Employee Assistance \nProgram at 1 -800-222-0364.  \n An OSHA managers’ concern for an employee’s personal problem is relevant only if \nthe problem causes difficulties in the work setting.  \n1. Individuals makin g referrals under the EAP must not attempt to delve into or \ndiagnose an employee’s problem.  \n2. Employees must not be coerced or forced to use the program.  \n3. Discussions should focus solely on job performance issues.  \n Employees who coordinate visits to the EAP wi th Responsible OSHA Manager(s) \nwill be considered to be on official duty while meeting with the EAP.   \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 24-139 1. While employees must inform their supervisor and obtain permission to be \naway from their job assignment for an appointment, they do not have to \ndisclose the nature of the problem for which they wish to see the counselor.  \n2. The Department allows an employee up to one hour (or more as necessitated \nby travel time) of excused absence for each counseling session during the \nassessment/referral phase of rehabilitat ion.   \n3. If the EAP makes a referral to an outside source, absences during duty hours \nfor rehabilitation or treatment must be charged to the appropriate leave \ncategory  \n Employees participating in the EAP through self -referral without the supervisor’s \nknowledg e must use sick leave or annual leave for visits to the EAP during work \nhours.  \n Any information or reports from the EAP counselor may only be released with \nwritten consent by the employee to individuals specifically identified by the \nemployee, or released under a court order.   \n In a case involving a traumatic incident, the EAP should be contacted as a resource \nbecause post -traumatic stress can be a serious problem.  EAP can send a Critical \nIncident Stress Management (CISM) Team to the office within 3 -5 days  after a \ntraumatic event occurs.   \n The union representative can also refer an employee to the EAP.  \n  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-140 CHAPTER 25.  MEDICAL MANAGEMENT  \nI. Purpose  \nThis chapter cancels the Compliance Safety and Health Officer (CSHO) Medical \nExamination Program (OSHA Instructions PER 04 -00-002 and PER 04 -00-003) and \nestablishes the OSHA Medical Examination Program.

Significant Changes  \n All personnel assigned to field duties in which there is reasonable anticipation of \nencountering physical, chemical and/or biological hazards are covered in the \nmandatory OSHA Medical Examination Program.  \n Members of Regional Response Teams and Specialized Response Teams must mee t \nthe medical qualifications of the OSHA Medical Examination Program prior to \nResponse Team assignment and throughout the duration of that assignment.  \n Based on the specific characteristics of the affected positions, and to be consistent \nwith the practices of other federal agencies and accepted public health practices, \nmedical history and physical examination will be performed during the Pre -placement \nExamination, then every three years until age 50, then every two years until age 65, at \nwhich time the Perio dic Physical Examination will be completed every year.  \n Medical evaluations of covered employees will take place in the years in which the \nPeriodic Physical Examination is not scheduled.  The Interim Medical Evaluation will \ninclude audiometric testing, a r espirator questionnaire and a blood pressure \ndetermination.  Additional testing, such as pulmonary function testing, may be \nconducted if indicated.   \n Under this Program, chest X -rays are voluntary after the initial Pre -placement \nExamination unless the empl oyee has experienced an occupational exposure that \ntriggered the medical surveillance requirements of an OSHA standard.  If an exposure \ndoes trigger the requirements of a standard, the schedule for chest X -rays established \nby that standard will be followed .  \n The responsibilities of the Regional Office and the covered employees are more \nclearly defined (see paragraph XVIII).  \nVIII.  Application  \n Covered Positions  \n1. General Application.  This instruction applies OSHA -wide to positions in \nwhich there is reasonable anticipation of encountering physical, chemical \nand/or biological hazards.  This includes employees whose duties require on -\nsite inspections, on -site evaluat ions and/or on -scene emergency response \nfunctions.  The OSHA Medical Examination Program application includes, \nbut is not limited to, the following positions:  \nStudent Trainee  \nSafety Specialist  \nLead Safety & Occupational Health Specialist  \nSafety & Occupati onal Health manager  \nIndustrial Hygienist  \nLead Industrial Hygienist  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-142 Safety Engineer  \nLead Safety Engineer  \nSupervisory Safety Engineer  \nCompliance Assistance Specialist  \n \nEmployees in these or similar job categories whose duties do NOT require \non-site inspectio ns, on -site consultations and evaluations, and/or on -scene \nemergency response functions are NOT covered by this Medical \nExamination Program.   \n2. Response Team Members.  Members of Regional Response Teams and the \nSpecialized Response Teams must meet the minim um medical/physical \nrequirements of this program prior to Response Team assignment and for the \nduration of that assignment.   They are required to complete the Periodic \nPhysical Examinations and Interim Medical Evaluations specified under this \ninstruction.  \n3. Trainees.  Student trainees are covered under this instruction if their tenure \nwith the Agency is expected to exceed a one -year period from their Pre -\nplacement Examination.  \n Medical Evaluation  \n1. Mandatory Examinations.  All covered employees are required to complete \nthe Periodic Physical Examinations and Interim Medical Evaluations as \nspecified under this instruction.  \n2. Voluntary Examinations.  Employees whose past work assignments with the \nAgency required them to make regular or occasional visits to industrial  \nestablishments where they may have been exposed to potentially toxic \nchemicals and/or biologic or physical hazards and whose job descriptions do \nnot now require them to go into the field are eligible for a Voluntary Physical \nExamination every three years.  \n Purpose of Medical Evaluation  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-143 1. Fitness for Duty.  Medical evaluations under this Program are required in \norder for the Agency to determine if covered employees are physically and \nmedically capable of performing the essential duties of the position \nefficiently and without posing a hazard  to themselves or others.   \n2. Complying with OSHA Standards.  Multiple OSHA standards require routine \nmedical tests in order to monitor the health of employees who are reasonably \nanticipated to experience exposures to potentially hazardous substances or \nphys ical hazards and who must be physically capable of safely utilizing \npersonal protective equipment.  Under this program, OSHA will comply with \nmedical requirements of existing OSHA standards as they pertain to OSHA \nemployees.  \nIX. Background  \n CSHO Medical Examina tion Program  \nPrior to April 1987, OSHA did not have a standardized medical examination program \nfor employees.  Each Region developed and implemented a medical program for its \nrespective employees and maintained authority over its operation.  The contents a nd \nadministration of these programs were subject to variation from one Region to \nanother.  \nIn order to establish a standardized agency -wide medical examination program and to \ncomply with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations and requirements, \nOSH A applied to OPM for a Single Agency Physical Examination Standard.  This \nstandard specified and justified the physical requirements that covered employees \nmust meet as a condition of employment.  The OSHA Single Agency Physical \nExamination Standard, appro ved by OPM in December 1985, was applicable to \nOSHA employees in certain job series and grades as well as to new employees hired \nfor these positions.  \n The CSHO Medical Examination Program began in April 1987.  The program \nrequired that all employees hired  to specific positions meet the physical qualification \nstandards as determined by a Pre -placement Examination.  On March 31, 1989, \nOSHA Instructions PER 8 -2.4 and PER 8 -2.5 were implemented for all covered \nemployees.  PER 8 -2.5 required that covered employ ees demonstrate requisite \nphysical capabilities by participating annually in the CSHO Medical Examination \nProgram.  \nSince implementation of the CSHO Medical Examination Program in April 1987, \nOSHA has maintained an interagency agreement with the Federal Oc cupational \nHealth (FOH) component of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) to provide the Pre -\nplacement, Annual and Voluntary medical examinations.  This arrangement has \nprovided OSHA with a single, nationwide provider of the medical services necessary \nto implement this Program.  \n Medical Evaluation Requirements of OSHA Standards  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-144 Multiple OSHA standards require periodic medical evaluations to monitor the health \nof employees who have reasonably anticipated exposures to physical, chemical or \nbiological hazards.  These standards apply to employees who experience an action \nlevel of exposure to the hazard addressed by the standard.  The OSHA standards that \nrequire medical evaluations are summarized in Appendix B.  \n Determination of Medical Evaluation Requirements  \nThis instruction establishes medical history and physical examination requirements \nbased on specific characteristics of the affected positions. These requirements are \nconsistent with the practices of other federal agencies and accepted public health \npractices.   The medical evaluation requirements mandated by OSHA standards will \ncontinue to be applied to covered employees (Appendix B).  This directive allows for \nflexibility and clinical judgment in determining the appropriate medical evaluation \nperiodicity for e ach covered employee.  Each employee will receive an annual \nexamination and will receive a notification regarding the type of exam that will be \nperformed the following year.  \n Protecting Employee Health & Safety  \nThough the OSHA Medical Examination Program do es change the frequency of the \nextensive medical questionnaire and physical examination, it provides a timely, \nannual occupational medicine evaluation for all covered employees.  It is also aligned \nwith current standards of occupational medicine and preven tive medicine practices \nthat are updated from the CSHO Medical Program.  Appendix C summarizes the \nsupporting logic for changes in the program.   \nX. Scheduling FOH Appointments  \nMandatory Periodic Physical Examinations are provided to all employees in covered \npositions (see section VIII).  \n Physical examinations and medical evaluations will be scheduled with FOH after \nOOM N authorization.   \n Examinations will be conducted during the employee’s normal duty hours and will be \nprovided free of charge to the employee.   \n Whenever possible, appointments should be scheduled within 30 calendar days of \nOOM N authorization and completed within 60 calendar days.  \n Employees shall notify their supervisors and applicable clinic personnel at least 24 \nhours in advance if they are unable to attend the examination at the scheduled time.  \nXI. Definitions of Periodicity  \n Pre-placement Examination  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-145 A medical history and physical examination is required once for all applicants prior to \nassignment to a covered position and for all employees prio r to transfer from a \nposition not covered by this instruction into a covered position.  Appendix D, Table 1 \nprovides a list of the components of the Pre -placement Examination.  Appendix E \nprovides additional policy and procedural information related unique ly to Pre -\nplacement Examinations.  \n Periodic Physical Examination  \nA mandatory medical history and physical examination for all covered employees \n(Appendix A).    \n1. Components.  Appendix D, Table 1 provides a list of the components of the \nPeriodic Physical Exam ination.   \n2. Frequency.  The Periodic Physical Examination is required every three years \nuntil age 50, then every two years until age 65.  After age 65 it is required \nannually.   \n3. Exceptions.  The frequency of the Periodic Physical Examination, or parts of \nthe examination, may be adjusted by the Office of Occupational Medicine \nbased on the following factors:  \na. When the employee is determined to have medical conditions that \nwarrant annual or biannual evaluations.  \nb. When an employee exposure reaches an action level  required in OSHA \nstandards or another occupational exposure of concern.   \nc. When a covered employee experiences a hospitalization, significant \nsurgery, or period of medical restrictions exceeding one month since \nthese situations may signal a need for more f requent or additional \nmedical evaluations.    \nd. When an employee’s work assignments may require the use of a Self -\nContained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA).  In such cases, additional \ntests and more frequent medical evaluations may be required.  \ne. When an employee h as incomplete past medical evaluations. All \nincomplete evaluations must be completed prior to eligibility for a \nsubsequent Periodic Physical Examination.  \n Interim  Medical Evaluation  \nA mandatory medical evaluation for covered employees.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-146 1. Components Included.  Appendix D, Table 1 provides a list of the \ncomponents of the Interim Medical Evaluation.  \n2. Frequency.  An Interim Medical Evaluation will be conducted for all covered \nemployees in the years in which a Periodic Physical Examination is not \nperformed.  \n3. Exceptions.  Incomplete past medical evaluations must be completed prior to \neligibility for a subsequent Interim Medical Evaluation.  \n Voluntary Physical Examination  \nAn optional medical examination offered to employees whose past work assignments \nwith the Agency would have required them to make visits to industrial sites where they \nmay have been exposed to chemical, physical or biological hazards and whose current job \ndescriptions no longer require them to perform field duties.  These examinations provide \ncontinued medical surveillance for conditions with a long latency period.   \n1. Components Included.  Appendix D, Table 1 provides a list of the \ncomponents of the Voluntar y Physical Examination.  \n2. Frequency.  A Voluntary Physical Examination can be obtained every 3 -\nyears.  \n3. Scheduling.  Voluntary Physical Examinations must be scheduled and \ncompleted during the fiscal year in which the exam was approved.   \n Self-Contained Breath ing Apparatus (SCBA) Medical Clearance  \nA mandatory medical evaluation, performed in addition to the periodic and interim \nevaluations, that determines an employee’s ability to safely wear Self -Contained \nBreathing Apparatus (SCBA).   \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-147 1. Components Included.  Ap pendix D, Table 1 provides a list of the additional \nmedical services associated with SCBA clearance.  Most significantly, SCBA \nclearance requires a cardiac stress test for employees age 40 or older.  A \ncardiac stress test may be required for employees age 35 or older based on \ncardiac risk factors.   \n2. Frequency.  The appropriate frequency for SCBA medical clearance renewal \nis individualized for each employee and is determined by a reviewing \nphysician each time the medical evaluation is performed.  The frequen cy is \ndetermined by the opinion of the reviewing physician, based on the \nindividual’s health risks and the Elements of Physical Examination and \nMedical Evaluations listed in Table 1 for SCBA Clearance (Appendix D). \nIndividuals over 40 years of age must hav e a physical examination at least \nevery two years.  The SCBA clearance can be performed as part of the \nPeriodic Physical Examination or the Interim Medical Evaluation.  \nXII. Additional Medical Information  \nIn response to a physician’s report resulting from eithe r a Periodic Physical Examination \nor an Interim Medical Evaluation, OOM N may require additional medical information to \nassess an employee’s medical condition(s) before determining medical fitness to perform \nrequired duties.  In these situations, OOM N will notify, in writing, both the employee and \nthe Regional Office that additional services are required.  These additional tests and \nevaluations are considered a continuation of the scheduled examination/evaluation.   \n Additional FOH Services  \nEither while still  at the FOH clinic or subsequently, additional tests that are part of the \nregular services provided by FOH may be authorized by OOM N.  For example, a \nreview of a respiratory protection questionnaire may reveal an issue that requires \nspirometry.  Costs asso ciated with these FOH services will be covered by the \nNational Office through the FOH agreement.  \n Medical Specialist Opinions  \nWhen a covered employee does not meet the established criteria for fitness for duty, \nbut OOM N is unable to render a medical opinion  as to detailed aspects of the \nemployee’s fitness to perform his or her job functions, the employee and the Regional \nOffice will be informed, in writing, that a specialist’s medical evaluation, limited to \nthe area(s) of concern, is required.    The employe e must comply with the written \nnotification from OOM N in a timely manner, usually within thirty (30) calendar days \nof employee receipt of the notification.   \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-148 1. Selection of Consulting Physician   \nWhen the need for additional medical information requires the use of a \nmedical specialist, after consultation with OOM N regarding the appropriate \nspecialty of the physician, the employee selects a qualified physician.  The \nconsulting physician should be board certified in the area of the potentially \ndisqualifying con dition (e.g., a cardiologist for cardiovascular conditions).  \nThe employee shall notify the Regional Office when an appointment has \nbeen scheduled.  \n2. Payment for Consulting Physician and/or Additional Tests   \nRegional Offices are responsible for payment of t he cost of medical specialist \nopinions and associated medical tests specified by OOM N.  Additional \ntesting requested by a consulting physician must be approved by OOM N \nprior to authorization for payment by the Agency.  OOM N will approve \npayment only for te sting that is necessary for determining fitness for duty.  If \nadditional tests are completed, but are NOT approved by OOM N, employees \nare responsible for payment.  Employees should consult their administrative \nofficers for guidance on how to arrange paymen t. \n3. Medical Specialist Opinion   \nThe medical specialist’s opinion will be used in reassessing the individual’s \nmedical qualifications for duty and in determining if specific tasks can be \nsafely performed (e.g. using a  negative pressure respirator, carrying  40 lbs. \nof equipment, driving).  This medical information may be shared with FOH \nReviewing Medical Officers (RMOs) or other contracted medical \nprofessionals, if needed,  for future medical clearances.  OOM N will notify \nthe employee and Regional Administrat or (RA) or designee if there is any \nfailure to meet medical requirements and will advise the RA regarding job \nrestrictions as appropriate.   \n Timelines  \nWhen additional services are required, the employee must comply with the written \nnotification from OOM N in a timely manner, usually within thirty (30) calendar days \nof employee receipt of the notification.  Communication with OOM N is required to \nobtain an extension.   If OOM N has not received pertinent additional medical \ninformation within the agreed upon tim e, notice will be sent to the RA or his/her \ndesignee so that appropriate administrative action may be taken.  \nXIII.  Incomplete Medical Examinations  \nWhen components of a mandatory medical examination or any additional examination \nare not completed as requested, OO MN will notify the RA or designee that it is unable to \nrender a medical opinion as to the fitness of the employee to perform his or her job \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-149 functions.  The RA or his/her designee will take appropriate administrative action to \nensure that OSHA medical evalu ations are completed.  \nXIV. Accommodations  \nNOTE:  The use of the term “accommodation” in this directive does not refer to \n“reasonable accommodation” under the law.  See DLMS -4 Chapter 306 Reasonable \nAccommodation for Employees and Applicants with Disabilities.    \n Overview  \nUpon notification that an employee does not meet one or more medical/physical \nrequirements of his/her position, the Regional Administrator will consider an \nappropriate accommodation plan.  The process of accommodating an employee \ninvolves job rea ssignment, job modification or job restriction.  An employee’s job \naccommodation is designed to avoid the aggravation of an existing medical condition \nand to avoid placing an employee in an occupational situation that is unsafe due to the \npresence of one o r more medical conditions. Only management may seek \naccommodation of employees under this program.  Accommodation plans are \nproposed by RAs and are reviewed and concurred on by the National Office.  Duty \nrestrictions may be temporary, as in the case of a c orrectable condition, or they may \nbe permanent.  Accommodations for permanently restrictive conditions will be made \non a case -by-case basis.  \n Interim Work Restrictions  \nIn order to ensure that employees are not put at risk between the time they are found \nnot to meet one or more medical/physical requirements of their positions and final \naccommodation, Regional Administrators shall consult with OOM N and put in place, \nwithin 10 working days of notification by OOM N, temporary working restriction(s) \nlimiting work assignments and/or working conditions until accommodations are \nfinalized.  \n Regional/OO NM Consultation  \nThe affected employee's supervisor, Area Director, and/or RA shall confer with the \nOOM N physicians to determine what restrictions or limitations should be placed on \nan individual employee.  This will ensure that restrictions and limitations are \npertinent to currently assigned duties and potential future duties.  \n Request for Accommodation  \nThe accommodation plan shall include the specific details describing how  the \nemployee will be accommodated (i.e., job restriction or job reassignment).   The final \nterms of the accommodation plan proposals will be made by the RA.  The RA shall \nforward the proposed accommodation plan to OOM N. \n Medical Review  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-150 A physician in OOM N shall review the request to ensure that the terms of the \naccommodation plan are medically appropriate.  \n Coordination of Accommodation Plan  \nOOM N will coordinate review and concurrence of the accommodation plan with \nOSHA’s Human Resource Office, the Office of the Assistant Secretary, and the \nDirector of Technical Support and Emergency Management.  The purpose of the \nNational Office review is to ens ure national consistency of application.  \nAccommodation requests will generally be reviewed on a monthly or bimonthly \nbasis.  OOM N will notify Regional Administrators when their accommodation plans \nare scheduled for review.  In order to expedite resolution  of issues, Regional \nAdministrators or their designees will be invited to join the meeting  \n Limited Duty  \nThis program does not change procedures that Area Offices are presently using to \nprovide limited duty for an employee with a temporary condition such as  a broken leg \nor pregnancy.  If an adverse medical condition is correctable (e. g. hernia or high \nblood pressure), OSHA may require medical attention for that condition and establish \na reasonable deadline by which time the condition must be corrected or con trolled, in \norder to meet medical requirements.  \nXV. Worker’ Compensation and Other Employee Benefits  \nNone of the policies or procedures in this instruction affects existing employee options or \nbenefits for disability retirement, Workers’ Compensation, and/or a ny other employment \nbenefit programs.  \nXVI.

Purpose.   \nOSHA personnel conduct on -site inspections, on -site evaluations and/or on -scene \nemergency response functions at industrial establishments to observe and evaluate \nconditions to which employees are exposed.  During these inspections, OSHA employees \nmay be exposed to potent ially hazardous situations and substances. The application of a \nsingle medical requirements standard to all affected employees ensures that the health of \nOSHA employees will be at a level that permits them to perform job -related assignments \nsafely, effecti vely, and without hazard to themselves or others.  \nII. Rationale for the Necessity of Physical Requirements.   \nThe following is a general description of the physical requirements of the positions \naffected by the OSHA Medical Examination Program.    \n The duties o f these positions require employees to perform under conditions that vary \nfrom sedentary to maximum exertion. Normal working conditions also require the \nemployee to perform in a reliable manner under adverse conditions. Employees \nexamine and report on pote ntially hazardous worksite conditions. This may include \nworking at heights, underground, in confined spaces, in poorly lighted facilities, in \nemergency situations, and work in environments with chemical, physical, and \nbiological hazards which are regulated  by the OSH Act.  \n Many of the hazards that OSHA employees may face are regulated by established \nOSHA standards which require the use of personal protective equipment and/or \nroutine medical monitoring. The proper use of personal protective equipment require s \nan evaluation of the wearer’s ability to utilize the equipment safely and without \nadverse effect to the wearer’s health. Adverse conditions sometimes occur \nunexpectedly, while others are anticipated and appropriate steps can be taken in an \norderly and co ntrolled manner to protect oneself and safely leave the hazard area.  \nIII. Medical Examinations.  \n Before assuming duty and routinely during employment, applicants and employees in \naffected positions must undergo a medical examination and be physically and \nmedica lly capable of performing the essential duties of the position efficiently and \nwithout hazard to themselves or others.  \n Routine medical evaluations serve to monitor the employee’s health status to ensure \nthat he or she maintains physical capabilities to me et the qualifications of his/her \nposition. In addition, routine medical surveillance uncovers conditions which may \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-159 develop as a result of occupational exposures which have long latency periods for \nsymptom development.  \n Failure to meet the physical and medi cal requirements of Pre -placement \nExaminations will be considered to disqualify an employee for a covered position.  \n Failure to meet the physical and medical requirements of Periodic Physical \nExaminations will be considered disqualifying, except when there  is sufficient \nevidence that individuals can perform the essential functions of the job efficiently and \nwithout risk to themselves or others, with or without appropriate accommodation.    \nIV. Medical Examination Parameters.  \n Vision.   \n1. Physical Requirement. Dis tant visual acuity must be at least 20/40 in each \neye separately, with or without corrective lenses. Distant binocular acuity \nmust be at least 20/40 with or without corrective lenses. Near visual acuity \nmust be at least 20/40 in each eye separately, with o r without corrective \nlenses. Near binocular acuity must be at least 20/40 with or without \ncorrective lenses. Field of vision must be 85 degrees in the horizontal \nmeridian in each eye. The ability to distinguish the colors red, amber, and \ngreen is required for the Pre -placement examination.    \n2. Work Activity. Routinely assigned to areas where: the reading of \ncomprehensive literature is necessary; both near and far visual acuity are \nnecessary for hazard recognition; potentially life - threatening environments \nexist (therefore, accurate reading of personal protective equipment labeling is \nrequired); color coded warning signs represent hazardous conditions; routine \nutilization of finely calibrated equipment.   \n3. Rationale. OSHA employees inspect workplaces where potential safety and \nhealth hazards exist or can spontaneously occur. Once these hazards occur, \ninspection personnel must be capable of determining what actions are \nappropriate in order to safeguard the sa fety and health of themselves and \nothers. These actions will always require both near and far visual acuity. For \nexample, employees may need to quickly ascertain the condition of a \nrespirator for use in the case of an emergency egress situation. (This requ ires \nreading finely calibrated air gauges.) While making routine inspections, a \ncompliance officer may encounter situations where full field of vision will be \nnecessary in order to avoid a serious accident. For example, while working \non high scaffolding, i t may be necessary to rapidly descend. Normal field of \nvision is necessary to perform this activity safely.  \n Hearing.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-160 1. Requirement. Average hearing loss in the better ear cannot be greater than 40 \ndecibels at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz, and 2,000 Hz, with or without  a hearing aid.   \n2. Work Activity. Covered employees are routinely assigned to areas where a \nbroad spectrum of physical hazards exists, including environmental noise \nlevels above 90 decibels.  \n3. Rationale. It is important that a covered employee maintain adequ ate \nauditory acuity to communicate and give instructions in a noisy environment. \nDuring the course of daily activities, it is important for employees to hear \ninstructions and communications in order to ensure safety. A greater than 40 \ndecibel loss of audit ory acuity in the speech frequencies in the better ear may \ninterfere with the employee’s ability to communicate under noisy conditions.   \n Musculoskeletal.  \n1. Requirement. Employees must have:  The functional use of both hands, arms, \nlegs, and feet; No impair ment of the use of a leg, a foot, an arm, a hand, the \nfingers, back or neck which would most likely interfere with the functional \nrequirements of this position; No established medical history or clinical \ndiagnosis of rheumatic, arthritic, orthopedic, muscu lar, neuromuscular, or \nvascular disease which would interfere with the ability to perform the \nfunctional requirements of this position.  \n2. Work Activity.  A covered employee is required to perform moderate lifting, \ncarrying, walking and standing.  A covered e mployee will routinely be \nrequired to ascend or descend heights in order to safely egress from a \npotentially hazardous area. During routine activities, a covered employee \nmust carry portable scientific equipment.  \n3. Rationale. It is imperative that a covered employee have no impairment of \nthe hands, arms, legs, feet, back or neck which would prevent performing the \nfunctional requirements of moderate lifting, carrying, reaching above the \nshoulder, standing, walking and climbing.  An established medical history of \narthritis or muscular pathology that would interfere with these functional \nrequirements could cause a potentially hazardous situation in the workplace.  \n Cardiopulmonary.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-161 1. Requirement. No current clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction, angina \npectori s, coronary insufficiency, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, or any other \ncardiovascular or cardiopulmonary disease that would likely cause syncope, \ndyspnea, collapse, or cardiac failure.  No established medical history or \nclinical diagnosis of cardiac or respi ratory dysfunction likely to interfere with \nthe ability to wear a respirator.  \n2. Work Activity.  A covered employee will routinely be required to: perform \nmoderate lifting, carrying, walking and standing; ascend or descend heights \nin order to safely egress f rom a potentially hazardous area; wear a negative \npressure air -purifying respirator; operate a motor vehicle, including a 4 -\nwheel drive vehicle.  \n3. Rationale. Since covered employees may need to rapidly egress from heights \nor depths, it is imperative that no established medical history of significant \ncardiac or pulmonary disease exists. It is known that carrying heavy \nequipment while ascending or descending great heights places an excess \nburden on the cardio -pulmonary system.  Therefore, it is imperative that the \ncardio -vascular system be without significant pathology.  Since a covered \nemployee is required to wear a negative pressure respirator, it is imperative \nand required by OSHA standard 1910.134 that a physician medically \nqualifies the employee to wear suc h a respirator. It is known that pre -existing \ncardiac or respiratory disease can prevent an individual from wearing such a \nrespirator.  \n General Medical.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-162 1. Requirement. No diagnosis of a medical condition that is likely to cause \nsignificantly impaired perform ance or sudden incapacitation, e.g. \nuncontrolled seizures, use of prescription medication that causes significant \nsedation, or other significant impairment. When the consensus expert opinion \nin OOM N determines that, for a given individual, the sedative pro perties of \nthat employee's required medication poses an unacceptable risk, the \nemployee will not receive full medical clearance.  Appropriate job \nrestrictions will be considered. This does not apply to use of over -the-counter \nmedications.  \n2. Work Activity.  C overed employees work in locations with known physical, \nchemical and biological hazards. Covered employees often work alone in \nisolated locations, may be required to work at heights, and often drive for \nlong periods of time in the course of their duties.  \n3. Rationale. Covered employees must work in an environment where sudden \nincapacitation might endanger themselves or others. Therefore, covered \nemployees must be free of known medical conditions that are anticipated to \ncause significantly impaired performance  or sudden incapacitation.   \n  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-163 APPENDIX B  \nMEDICAL EVALUATION R EQUIREMENTS OF OSHA STANDARDS  \nCertain OSHA standards have medical surveillance requirements at prescribed intervals. For \nexample, the Occupational Hearing Conservation standard (29 CFR 1010.95)  requires an annual \naudiogram for employees who experience occupational noise exposure at or above the action \nlevel of an 8 -hour time -weighted average of 85 decibels.  For most hazard exposures for which \nthe standard requires periodic medical surveillance,  medical surveillance is required on an annual \nbasis and thus will exceed the standard frequency of the Periodic OSHA medical examinations \nwhich occurs at three -year intervals.   \nFollowing are brief summaries of the medical surveillance/medical monitoring requirements for \neach standard, as they might pertain to the duties of OSHA covered employees. These summaries \ndo not include specific details from the standards such as on which organ systems the physician \nor licensed healthcare provider must focus when o btaining the medical histories or performing \nthe physical examinations.  \n________________________________________________________________________  \nAcrylonitrile  29 CFR 1910.1045:  For exposures to acrylonitrile at or above the action level of 1 \nppm as an 8 -hour time -weighted average, this standard mandates a medical and work \nhistory and a complete physical examination, a 14 x 17 inch postero -anterior chest \nradiograph and a fecal occult blood test for employees 40 years of age or older at the time \nof the work assignment and at least annually thereafter if the exposure continues.  The \nstandard denotes organ systems and non -specific symptoms to which particular attention \nis to be paid during the taking of the histories and performance of the physical \nexamination.  \nAsbestos  (Construction and Shipyards) 29 CFR 1926.1101(m) and 29 CFR 1915.1101(m): These \nstandards require a medical and work history, physical examination, pulmonary function \ntest at least annually for exposures at or above the Permissible Exposure Limit  (PEL) for \n30 or more days a year or exposed above the Excursion Limit.  \nAsbestos  (General Industry) 29 CFR 1910.1001: When exposed at or above the PEL or above the \nExcursion Limit, the employee is required to complete a standardized questionnaire (from \nAppendix D of the standard) and have a physical examination annually.  A postero -\nanterior view chest radiograph of 14 X 17 inches is to be done based on length of \nemployment and age of the employee.  This film is to be read by a B -reader.  \nBenzene  (General Ind ustry, Construction and Shipyards, respectively) 29 CFR 1910.1028, 29 \nCFR 1926.1129, 29 CFR 1015.1028: For employees exposed at or above the action level \nfor 30 or more days per year or at or above the PEL for 10 or more days per year, these \nstandards requ ire initial and annual medical and work histories and physical examinations \nand a complete blood count with differential and quantitative platelet count.  Employees \nwho must wear respirators 30 or more days per year are required to have a pulmonary \nfunctio n test at least every 3 years under these standards.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-164 1,3-Butadiene  29 CFR 1910.1051: Employees exposed at or above the action level for 30 or \nmore days per year or at or above the PEL on 10 or more days per year or at or above the \nShort -term Exposure Limit  (STEL) on 10 or more days per year should have an annual \nhealth questionnaire (from Appendix C of the standard or its equivalent), an annual \ncomplete blood count with differential and platelet count, and a physical examination at \nleast every 3 years.  The  physical examination should be done more often if advised by \nthe physician or other licensed healthcare professional (PLHC) who reviews the \nquestionnaire and the results from the blood test.  \nCadmium  (General Industry, Construction, Shipyards and Agricultu re, respectively) 29 CFR \n1910.1027, 29 CFR 1026.1127, 29 CFR 1915.1027 and 29 CFR 1928.1027: Employees \nwho experience exposure to Cadmium at or above the action level for 30 or more days \nduring any 12 consecutive months should have medical surveillance pro vided at the \nintervals required under the standards.  Surveillance includes initial and periodic medical \nand work histories and examinations, chest radiographs, pulmonary function tests, blood \ntests, urinalysis and biological monitoring tests which include  urine test for cadmium and \nBeta-2 microglobulin and a blood test for cadmium. The first periodic medical \nsurveillance shall be provided within one year after the initial examination and then , at a \nminimum, biennially.  \nCarcinogens  29 CFR 1910.1003, 29 CFR 1926.1103, 1915.1003:  This group of standards for \ngeneral industry, construction and shipyards, respectively, require an annual medical and \nwork history and physical examination for employees who must enter, as part of their \nassigned work, regulated areas  at worksites where any of the 13 chemicals identified as \ncarcinogens are manufactured, processed, repackaged, released, handled or stored.  \nChromium  (VI) (General Industry, Construction and Shipyards, respectively): 29 CFR \n1910.1026, 29 CFR 1926.1126, 29 C FR 1915.1026: These standards require initial and \nannual medical history and physical examination for employees with exposure at or \nabove the action level for 30 or more days per year.  \nCoke Oven Emissions  29 CFR 1910.1029: For employees who are in the regu lated area for at \nleast 30 days per year, the employer shall provide initial and annual medical and work \nhistories, a postero -anterior view chest radiograph, a pulmonary function test, weight, \nphysical examination of the skin, a urinalysis and urine cytolo gy test.  \nCompressed Air  29 CFR 1926.803: Medical surveillance requirements for this standard were not \nincluded in this summation because it is unlikely that OSHA covered employees will \nenter a compressed air environment.  \nCotton Dust  29 CFR 1910.1043: This standard requires annual medical surveillance for \nemployees exposed above the action levels set for cotton dust.  Biennial surveillance is \nrequired for those employees exposed below the action levels.  The surveillance consists \nof a medical history plus a questionnaire from Appendix B of the standard and pulmonary \nfunction testing.  Surveillance frequency is increased to every six months for employees \nwith specific pulmonary function test findings described in the standard.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-165 1,2-Dibromo -3-chloropropane (DBCP ) (General Industry, Construction and Shipyards) 29 CFR \n1910.1044, 29 CFR 1926.1144, 29 CFR 1915.1044: initial and annual medical and work \nhistories, physical examination, blood serum test for FSH, LH, total serum estrogen (in \nfemale employees) and a sperm  count (in male employees) are required for employees \nwho work in regulated areas with occupational exposure to DBCP.  \nEthylene Oxide  29 CFR 1910.1047, 29 CFR 1926.1147 (General Industry and Construction): For \nemployees exposed at or above the action level for 30 or more days per year, the \nstandards require initial and annual medical and work histories, physical examinations \nand a complete blood count with differential.  \nFormaldehyde  (General Industry, Construction and Shipyards): 29 CFR 1910.1048, 29 CFR \n1926.1148, 29 CFR 1915.1048 – The standards require medical and work histories \ninitially and annually and physical examinations at the discretion of the physician based \non review of the medical history of employees with exposure to formaldehyde at or above \nthe action level or exceeding the STEL. An annual physical examination is mandated for \nthose employees who are required to wear a respirator.  This evaluation must include a \nyearly pulmonary function test.  \nHazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response  (General Industry and Construction) 29 \nCFR 1910.120, 29 CFR 1926.65: The standard requires an annual or biennial medical and \nwork history and physical examination for employees exposed to hazardous substances at \nor above the PEL, or if there is no PEL, at or  above the published exposure levels for 30 \nor more days a year.  \nInorganic Arsenic  (General Industry, Construction and Shipyards) 29 CFR 1910.1018, 29 CFR \n1926.1118, 1915.1018: For employees with exposure above the action level for 30 or \nmore days per year , an initial and annual medical and work history and physical \nexamination.  The examination shall include a postero -anterior view chest radiograph of \n14 X 17 inches in size.  \nLead  (General Industry and Shipyards) 29 CFR 1910.1025, 29 CFR 1915.1025: These st andards \nrequire medical surveillance for employees exposed above the action level for more than \n30 days per year.

The medical surveillance consists of annual updates of \nmedical and work his tories and, for employees 45 years of age or older , annual physical \nexaminations; employees less than 45 years of age are to have physical examinations \nevery 36 months.  \nMethylenedianiline  (General Industry and Construction) 29 CFR 1910.1050, 29 CFR 1926.60 : \nThese standards require medical surveillance for employees with exposures at or above \nthe action level for 30 or more days per year or dermal exposure for 15 or more days per \nyear.  The surveillance includes annual medical and work histories for issues p ertinent to \nmethylenedianiline exposures, physical examination, blood tests for liver functions, and a \nurinalysis. Medical surveillance is required for emergency exposures.  \nOccupational Noise Exposure  29 CFR 1910.95: This standard requires surveillance for  noise -\ninduced hearing loss.  The surveillance consists of a baseline and annual audiogram for \nemployees with noise exposure at or above an 8 -hour TWA of 85 decibels. If the annual \naudiogram shows a standard threshold shift, the employer may have the audio gram \nrepeated within 30 days.  \nRespiratory Protection  (General Industry and Construction) 29 CFR 1910.134, 29 CFR \n1926.103: These standards require administration and evaluation of a mandatory medical \nquestionnaire prior to fit testing or respirator use.  If any of the answers to questions 1 to \n8 in Part A, Section 2 of the questionnaire are positive, a medical examination is required. \nThere is no mandated periodicity for use of a respiratory questionnaire or medical \nexamination.  The standards state situat ions that trigger the requirement for repeat \nmedical evaluations for respirator use.  \nVinyl Chloride  (General Industry and Construction) 29 CFR 1910.1017, 29 CFR 1926.1117: \nAccording to these standards, employees exposed in excess of the action level are \nrequired to have a medical and work history, a physical examination, blood tests for total \nbilirubin,  alkaline phosphatase, SGOT, SGPT and GGT on an annual basis, and every six \nmonths if over 10 years of exposure. Each employee exposed in an emergency shall be \nafforded appropriate medical surveillance.  \n \n  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-167 APPENDIX C  \nPROTECTING EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY  \nThe primary goals of the OSHA Medical Examination Program are to determine fitness -for-duty \nand to provide medical surveillance for occupational exposures, as indicated.  The intent of this \nProgram is to assure that OSHA covered employees are physically ab le to safely perform \nassigned duties.  In addition, the Program provides limited health promotion services that do not \nreplace the need for personal health care.  Employees are encouraged to share examination \nresults with their personal physicians.  \nAnnual Evaluations.  All covered employees will receive annual medical evaluations (either in \nthe form of a Periodic Physical Examination or an Interim Medical Evaluation) that include, at a \nminimum, medical surveillance for noise and medical clearance for respir ator use.  Employees’ \noccupational exposures that may require additional medical procedures/evaluation, for example, \nprior silica or asbestos exposure warranting chest x -ray with B -reading, are evaluated as part of \nthe Periodical Physical Examination and w henever management reports to OOM N a potential \nexposure that reaches an action level of an OSHA standard or another occupational exposure of \nconcern.  The periodicity of these examinations and evaluations aims to improve the timeliness \nof medical evaluatio ns and of any accompanying recommendations for alterations in duty, \ndesigned to protect employees.   \nPeriodicity.  This Program also reduces unnecessary testing for employees who are not likely to \nbenefit from annual, in -depth medical examinations, while m aintaining and updating \nrecommended health safeguards.  Unnecessarily frequent examinations may lead to false positive \nresults, additional unnecessary testing, anxiety and cost.  The age -based frequency for \ncompleting comprehensive physical examinations in  this Program is consistent with current \noccupational medicine practices.  No other federal agency is known to currently perform annual \ncomprehensive physical examinations for all employees in medical programs.  However, when \nclinically indicated for OSHA covered employees with significant health conditions, the \nfrequency of medical screening will be adjusted, and some employees with continue with \ncomprehensive annual physical examinations.  See the Table, below, for frequencies of physical \nexaminations con ducted on inspectors in other federal agencies.  \nRegulatory Requirements:  The implementation of an annual interim examination that includes a \nhearing conservation program in accordance with the Occupational Noise Exposure standard 29 \nCFR 1910.95, annual me dical clearance for respirator usage (29  CFR 1910.134), and interim \ntuberculosis screening according to need ensures that all covered employees receive appropriate \noccupational medical surveillance.  Because OSHA employees are not reasonably anticipated to  \nencounter other occupational hazards that meet action levels for medical surveillance, they are \nnot required or recommended to receive additional annual medical surveillance.   \nPreventive Medical Services:  The schedule of physical examinations in the OSH A Medical \nExamination Program is also consistent with current public health standards of practice for \npreventive medical services.  Public health guidelines that address periodicity recommendations \nfor the general public no longer recommend an annual compr ehensive medical history and \nphysical examination.  In 1984, the US Public Health Service commissioned the United States \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-168 Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to develop recommendations for clinicians on the \nappropriate use of preventive services such as  examinations, screening tests, counseling, \nchemoprophylaxis and immunizations ( http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstfix.htm#pocket ).

General.  The medical examination required herein will be conducted by a physician \nexperienced in occupational medicine, preferably by a physician who is a member of the \nAmerican College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine. The examining \nphysician or institution will provide special instructional material (such as necessary \nfasting periods or special eating instructions) to OSHA management which will in turn \nprovide this information to the examinee prior to the Periodic Physical Examinatio n. \nII. Medical History.  Review of the employee’s history must be conducted in regard to \npersonal and family medical history and a work history including occupational exposures \nto chemical and physical hazards.  \n Required Forms.  Covered employees shall complete  either the OSHA Medical \nProgram – Physician’s Report (OSHA -179) and OSHA Medical Program – Employee \nHistory (OSHA -178) or the OSHA Respirator Medical Evaluation Questionnaire \n(Mandatory) (FOH -22) and provide them to the physician prior to the examination.   \nBoth are multi -page forms for recording the affected OSHA employee’s medical and \noccupational history.  \n Discussion with Physician.  There shall be an examining room discussion between the \nemployee and the physician regarding medical history, with special  attention given to \nthe questionnaire on hazardous occupational exposures.  \nIII. Specific Examination Tests and Requirements. The physical examination should include, \nbut not be limited to, a review of the following: head and neck, including visual tests, an \nexamination of the eyes, ears, nose and throat, an examination of the respiratory, \ncardiovascular and central and peripheral nervous systems, an examination of the \nabdomen, a voluntary examination of the rectum and genito -urinary system, an \nexamination of the  spine and other musculoskeletal systems, and an examination of the \nskin. Specific tests/measurements to be obtained include:  \n Height and weight.  \n Temperature, pulse, respiration rate, blood pressure.  \n Eye examination, including:  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 25-171 1.

General  \nIn any situation, personnel should not needlessly place themselves in a situation where they may \nhave exposure, or their equipment/clothing become contaminated.  Avoidance of exposure to \npersons, clothing or equipment is critical for all compliance personnel, regardless of their \ndesignation under the exposure control plan.  PP E should not be used as a substitute for the \navoidance of exposure to blood or OPIM.  \nIn emergencies (providing first aid  or Good Samaritan acts), or other situations where contact \ncannot be avoided, appropriate work practice controls, PPE, and other equipm ent must be used to \nprevent exposure.  \nIn cases where contact does occur, preventing the spread of contamination beyond areas of initial \ncontact is of utmost importance and appropriate steps need to be taken to prevent this spread.  \nAny known or suspected co ntact or contamination of persons, clothing, equipment or work areas \nwith blood or another potentially infectious body material (OPIM) must be addressed through \ndecontamination and appropriate follow -up procedures.   \nII. Procedures  \n Decontamination of body surf aces \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 26-188 1. When their hands or any other skin surface may have come in contact with \nblood or OPIM, employees shall immediately wash with soap and water.  \n2. Antiseptic hand cleansers and towels, or antiseptic towellettes may be used to \nwash with if access to soap or  water is not immediately available.  \nEmployees must, however, immediately wash skin surfaces with soap and \nwater as soon as it is available.  \n3. Employees must immediately flush their eyes or other mucous membrane \nsurfaces with water when they have come in co ntact with blood or OPIM.  \n4. Employees shall wash their hands (or other appropriate skin surfaces) after \nremoving or handling gloves, PPE or other coverings which were used to \nprotect against contact with blood or OPIM.  \n5. If skin contact is suspected, the empl oyee must examine the affected area to \ndetermine if an exposure incident may have occurred.  \n6. In accordance with the Office Exposure Control Plan, report all exposures \nand exposure incidents to the responsible OSHA manager as soon as possible \nand enact appro priate follow -up steps as called for in the Office Exposure \nControl Plan.  \n Equipment and Clothing  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 26-189 1.

Where the equipment may cause puncturing, it will be \nplaced in a puncture -resistant, leak -proof container.  If the equipment is \ndisposable, it may be left on -site, if the site will be disposing of other \ncontaminated equipment.   \n8. viii) If regulated waste is generated, it will be placed in red bags and put in \nthe appropriate waste containers for disposal in accordance with applicable \nregulations.  For a definition of regulated waste see the Bloodborne \nPathogens standard 29 CFR 1910.1030 (b). If waste is not regulated waste, it \nmay be thrown out in the normal trash  \n Work Surfaces  \nAny work surface which has been contaminated by blood/OPIM will be promptly \ndisinfected using a 1:10 – 1:100 solution of bleach (prepared daily) and/or an \nEPA/FDA registered sterilant.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 26-190 1.

Employees shall wash their hands (or other skin surfaces) after removing or \nhandling PPE or other coverings which were used to protect against contact \nwith blood or OPIM.  \n Laundry  \n1. All contaminated articles of clothing that are not disposable will be laundered \naccording to the Office designated laundry service. The responsible OSHA \nmanager will be alerted any time laundering of contaminated clothing needs \nto be performed.  Contaminated clothing will be handled on a case -by-case \nbasis, in accordance with guidelines established by the Office.   \n2. The responsible OSHA manager and Bloodborne Pathogens Coordinator are \nresponsible for contacting a laundry facility to ensure that they are able to \nhandle this t ype of laundry.  \n3. Laundering of contaminated clothing/PPE will be performed in accordance \nwith the Office guidelines.  \nIII. Post-Exposure Protocol  \n Following occupational exposure, employees will notify their responsible OSHA \nmanager and will then jointly contact the Office of Occupational Medicine  and \nNursing  (OOM N) immediately.  If the OOM N Medical Officer, following discussion \nwith the employee, determines that a likely percutaneous, mucous membrane, or non -\nintact skin exposure has occurred, the employee will report immediately to the nearest \nemergency medical facility to initiate appropria te post -exposure prophylaxis, which \nincludes assessment of baseline HIV, HBC and HBV status, post -exposure \nchemoprophylaxis as determined by the physician and employee, hyperimmune \nglobulin and full -series Hepatitis B immunization, as needed, and subsequen t medical \nfollow -up with follow -up serologic testing at times and locations convenient to the \nemployee, None of the cost will be borne by the employee.  \n Hepatitis B vaccinations will be made available at no cost to OSHA employees, at a \nreasonable time and place.  \n Post-exposure follow -up will be conducted for any employee who suffers an exposure \nincident while performing duties on the job at OSHA.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 26-191 1. Report to the responsible OSHA manager as soon as possible following an \nexposure incident to enact the Office pr ocedures for post -exposure follow -up.   \n2. If the responsible OSHA manager is unavailable, seek medical treatment \nfollowing an exposure incident, and enact appropriate provisions of the \nOffice post -exposure follow -up procedures.

General:  \nEmployees may be required to enter environments containing heavy metals and \nparticulates during their regular course of duty.  This document is designed to provide \nguidance as to the proper decontamination of personnel, clothing and equipment if toxic \nmetals or particulates are encountered or are known to be present.  \nII. Definitions:  \n \nDecontamination  The removal and disposal of a hazardous  substance from personnel, \nequipment and vehicles   \nClothing  Shall apply to any street or work attire worn by OSHA employees on \nthe job site including boots, hats, coveralls, and PPE  \nEquipment  Shall mean any tools or items needed in the performance of the  OSHA \nemployees’s job duties  \nToxic Metals  Toxic metals, including “heavy metals,” are individual metals and \nmetal compounds that negatively affect people’s health.  Examples \ninclude, but are not limited to, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, \nhexavalent chromium , lead, and mercury.  \nParticulate  Tiny particles of solid or liquid suspended in a gas - They range in \nsize from less than 10 nanometers to more than 100 micrometers in \ndiameter.  Examples include, but are not limited to, asbestos and dust.  \n \nIII. Procedures:  \n If the site has adequate decontamination facilities, inquire as to the use of those \nfacilities by the OSHA employee.  \n1. If the site has adequate decontamination facilities, the OSHA employee \nshould make arrangements with the employer to utilize those faciliti es. \n If the site does not have adequate decontamination facilities, the OSHA employee \nshould follow these procedures.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 26-193 1. All equipment and outer personal protective equipment should have gross \ncontamination removed by physical means involving \ndislodging/displa cement, rinsing, vacuuming with a HEPA vacuum or wiping \noff. \n2. Bag all contaminated equipment and clothing in plastic bags.   \n3. Use disposable cleansing towels to clean hands, face, and all exposed skin \nsurfaces.  \n OSHA employee shall not use compressed air and/or heat shall not be used to remove \ncontamination.  \n OSHA employees routinely conduct lead inspections in general industry and on \nconstruction work sites.  Often times, there are inadequate facilities available to the \nOSHA employee at the work site for p roper removal of lead and other heavy metals \nfrom  skin and surfaces (e. g. sampling equipment), resulting in the potential for \nOSHA employee exposure by the ingestion route and cross -contamination in \ngovernment vehicles, Area Offices and homes.  To address  this potential hazard, the \nOffice shall put together a decontamination kit that OSHA employees can take with \nthem in the field.  The kit includes the following.  \nLEAD / METAL D -CON KIT  \nITEM  USE  COST  \nD-WIPE TOWELS®  skin, equip. decontamination  48.00  \n(12 ca ns, 48 towels)  \nFULL DISCLOSURE®  skin, equip. decontamination  \nverification  2 @ 29.95  \n(kit) \nMoisturizing Shower \nGel®  skin, hair  13.00/4pk -8oz. \nGloves  hand protection  2 @ 9.27/BX100  \nZip lock Bags (8” x 10”)  disposal  2 @ 1.50/PK 25  \n*Zip lock Bags (XL)  storage (clothing)  12 @ 3.00 ea.

General  \nIn the course of work activity, OSHA employees may be subject to contamination by \nbiological agents.  Although exposure to many of these biological agents is unlikely an d \ngenerally unanticipated, care should be taken to identify the wide variety of potential \nexposures that may be experienced.  Unfortunately, a wide spectrum of biological \ncontaminants exists, most of which are outside the hazards normally anticipated with \ncompliance activities, but may be encountered in sites such as health care facilities and \nresearch labs.  As listed on OSHA’s Biological Agents – Safety and Health Topics, these \ncan include such diverse hazards as:  \nAnthrax  \nAvian Flu  \nBotulism  \nFoodborne Dise ase \nHantavirus  \nLegionnaires Disease  \nMold and Fungi  \nPlague  \nRicin  \nSARS  \nSmallpox  \nTuberculosis  \nTularemia  \nViral Hemorrhagic Fever.  \nQ Fever  \n \nThis wide spectrum of biological agents poses several potential problems to OSHA \nemployees, particularly because they represent:  \n- Significantly different risks and symptoms,  \n- Inhalation, ingestion and dermal routes of potential contamination, and  \n- Hazards that may not be anticipated until engaged in on -site activity.   \nHazard Assessment: Of primary importance is early identi fication of the potential for exposure.  \nAny indication that biological agents may be encountered during inspection activities must be \ntaken seriously and research should be conducted on the specific agents, routes of transmission \nand symptoms of exposure.   For example, a hazard bulletin in 1998 highlighted the potential for \nexposure to Legionnaire’s disease in the plastic injection molding industry.  Requirement for \nnegative pressure isolation rooms may be the subject of health care facilities with active cases of \nTuberculosis.   General infection control procedures may be the subject at a hospital or other \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 26-195 health care facilities.  Contact with surfaces contaminated with mold may transmit mold spores \nto equipment and ultimately to other (damp) surfaces that  may promote their growth. Contact \nwith contaminated water, sewage or decaying animal remains may expose an OSHA employee to \na wide variety of bacteria and viruses.  \nII. Procedures:  \n Pre-Inspection  \nIf a biological agent is referenced in the complaint / referral,  or there is any indication \nthe inspection activity may involve biological agents, the responsible OSHA manager \nshould be notified and research on the specific agents(s) conducted before initiating \nthe inspection.  \n Inspection Activities  \nIn health care setti ngs, appropriate infection control procedures, such as a negative \npressure isolation room for TB control, should be evaluated as soon as possible and \nwithout exposure to areas currently holding patients with active cases of contagious \ndisease.  \nWhen feasibl e, contact with surfaces and liquids (waste water) with the potential of \ncontamination with biological agents will be avoided.  \nWhen contact with potentially contaminated surfaces is necessary for collection of \nsamples or inspection related activities, appr opriate PPE, including rubber gloves, \nwill be worn, decontaminated or discarded.  \n Post Inspection  \nIf exposure to a biological agent is suspected, it shall be reported to the responsible \nOSHA manager who will refer for to a health professional for appropriat e medical \ntreatment.  \n Decontamination  \nUnless research has identified specific decontamination procedure guidelines, OSHA \n“General Decontamination” – Quick Card should be followed for potential skin,   \nclothing, equipment and surface decontamination.  These  guidelines include a \nqualitative assessment of the level of contamination and the use of solutions \ncontaining from ¼ to 1 ½ cups of bleach per gallon of water (prepared daily) and/or \nan EPA/FDA registered sterilant.   \n  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 26-196 APPENDIX D  \nOSHA GENERAL DECONTA MIN ATION QUICK CARD  \nGeneral Decontamination  \nFloodwaters may be contaminated with sewage and decaying animal and human remains. \nDisinfection of hands, clothing, tools/equipment, and surfaces in work areas is critical in disease \nprevention.  \nHand Decontamination  \n Wash hands completely with soap and water.  \n Rinse completely; dry with a clean towel or air dry.  \nClothing, Tool/Equipment Decontamination  \n It is preferable to use soap and clean water when available.  \n If only contaminated water is available, mix 1/4 cup bl each per gallon of water.  \n Immerse objects in solution for 10 minutes; if clothing, gently agitate periodically.  \n Transfer objects to hand wash solution for 10 minutes; if clothing, gently agitate \nperiodically.  \n Allow clothes and tools/equipment to thoroug hly air dry before re -use. \nSevere Surface Decontamination  \n Use for decontaminating only the most seriously affected surfaces.  \n Mix 1 and 1/2 cups bleach per gallon of water.  \n Douse surfaces with heavy contamination and allow to sit for 3 minutes.  \n Wipe the contamination from the surface with a paper towel and douse the surface again \nbut use the hand wash solution.  \n Wipe off residual contamination  with a paper towel.  \nImportant Considerations  \n Use gloves and eye protection.  \n Prepare bleach solutions daily and allow to stand for at least 30 minutes before use.  \n All containers should be labeled \"Bleach -disinfected water, DO NOT DRINK.\" \nCAUTION: Do not mix bleach with products containing ammonia.  \n Do not immerse electrical or battery operated tools/equipment in so lutions; clean exterior \nwith a soft cloth dampened with soap and water or disinfectant solution.  \n Follow electrical or battery operated equipment manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning. \nIt may be necessary to remove equipment from service for decontamination.  \n  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 26-197   \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 27-198 CHAPTER 27.  EXPOSURE MONITORING  \nI. Purpose  \nThis chapter establishes the OSHA Field Safety and Health Management System \n(SHMS) Exposure Monitoring Program.  The policies and procedures in this Program are \nintended to set broad expectations for “self -monitoring” to prevent employee illness, \ninjury or death from exposure to chemical and physical health hazards.  OSHA expects \nRegions, DTSEM, and DTE to develop specific procedures that align with this Program \nas needed.   \nThis Program is also intended to i dentify if OSHA employee exposures indicate a need \nfor short or long term medical intervention to prevent or respond to hazardous exposures.  \nThese procedures describe when and how to collect exposure data from select \nparticipating employees.  OSHA may als o use this self -monitoring data to make broad \ndeterminations about all covered employees’ exposure history.   \nII. Scope  \nThis chapter applies to all OSHA employees covered by the OSHA Field Safety and \nHealth Manual , (i.e., Covered Employees) . \nIII.

Responsibilities  \n Regional Administrators/Directorate Directors (RAs/Directors) are responsible for \neach employee’s work -related safety and health in the Region/Directorate and will:  \n1. Implement this Exposure Monitoring program in their Region/Directorate \nand develop specific procedures if necessary.  \n2. Support self -monitoring when setting performance expectations and \ndeveloping policies and procedures.  \n3. Provide managers with the authority and resources necessary to carry out \ntheir responsib ilities in the OSHA Exposure Monitoring Program.  \n4. Develop formal procedures to ensure employees are trained and that \nexposure data is annually reviewed and disseminated to affected employees \nand the SHMS Executive Steering Committee (ESC).   \n5. Request assista nce from the SLTC’s Health Response Team for \ninvestigations and inspections with the potential for exposure to chemical or \nphysical hazards when the Region/Directorate does not have the resources to \nsafely assess or conduct work activities.  \n Safety and Heal th Committees (SHCs) and equivalent for SLTC, CTC, and DTE are \nresponsible for tracking and evaluating field personnel exposures and will:  \n1. Evaluate over -exposure incidents to determine if appropriate protections \nwere used and what follow -up may be needed.  This evaluation is not for \ndisciplinary purposes.  \n2. Consult DTSEM’s Office of Occupational Medicine and Nursing (OOMN) \nwhen medical expertise is needed.  \n3. Review at least annually Region/SLTC/CTC/DTE exposure data for trends \nand lessons learned.  \n4. Conduct an an nual program review and make appropriate recommendations.  \n OOMN will provide consultation for OSHA field personnel in accordance with \nChapter 25, Medical Management.  \n Area Directors (AD) and equivalent for SLTC, CTC, and DTE are responsible for \nimplementing this Program in each Area Office/SLTC/CTC/DTE and will:  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 27-200 1. Ensure exposure -monitoring data is collected and recorded by field staff and \nreviewed by supervisors.  \n2. Ensure sampling media and direct reading equipment is readily available.  \n3. Train employees on hazard ous chemicals, as directed by the Regional Hazard \nCommunication Program and Chapter 12, Hazard Communication.  \n4. Ensure training is provided for all sampling equipment used.  \n5. Ensure the Regional SHC/equivalent for SLTC/CTC/DTE is notified of all \noverexposures.  \n Employees covered by the OSHA Field Safety and Health Manual (Covered \nEmployees) will participate in the OSHA Exposure Monitoring Program and will:  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 27-201 1. Exercise professional judgment to determine where potential exposures exist \nfor themselves as well as for e mployees working on site.  OSHA employees \nmay decide to self -monitor even if not required by this Program See Section \nV.A.1 for required monitoring.  \n2. Contact their supervisor for guidance if they are unsure about performing \nmonitoring prior to spending tim e in an area.  \n3. Perform necessary personal monitoring, wipe sampling, or bulk sampling of \noccupational health exposures.  \n4. Complete sampling documentation in the OSHA Information System (OIS), \nsee Appendix B, OIS Data Entry.  \n5. Notify the Assistant Area Director or other appropriate supervisor when self -\nsampling exposure levels exceed a published Occupational Exposure Limit \n(OEL) or when experiencing signs and symptoms of exposure.  \n6. Review the establishment’s Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) and/or chemical \ninventory in a ccordance with other provisions in the \nRegional/SLTC/CTC/DTE Safety and Health Program (e.g. Hazard \nCommunication Program) during the opening conference to evaluate the \npotential exposures that may be encountered during the inspection.  \nV. Exposure Data Collec tion Procedures  \nCovered OSHA employees will monitor their exposures to hazardous chemicals, noise, \nradiation, and other physical hazards.  Self -monitoring may include full shift monitoring, \nscreen sampling, passive sampling, and direct reading sampling.  Covered employees will \nuse professional judgment to determine the appropriate sampling method.  When \nconducting joint safety and health inspections, follow generally accepted industrial \nhygiene practices.  \nSample results are compared to the most protective Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL) \namong the following:  OSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL), the American \nConference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Value \n(TLV), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Recommended \nExposure Limit (REL), or thespecific manufacturer’s OEL.  \nBased on exposure monitoring data reviews, OOMN may request additional exposure \nmonitoring, in coordination with OSHA’s Field SHMS National Labor -Management \nSteering Committee, to support  a special chemical, noise, or other physical agent \nexposure study, using appropriate measures to prevent exposure.  \n Self-Monitoring for Hazardous Chemicals  \nCovered Employees will perform self -monitoring for hazardous chemical exposure \nwhere appropriate, ba sed on both professional judgment and the following conditions:  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 27-202 1. Self-monitoring is required when:  \na. A company’s employees are potentially exposed to chemicals at \nhazardous levels that justify taking air samples for measurement.  \nCovered Employees at the loc ation (e.g. in a joint safety and health \ninspection effort) may self -monitor, even if not taking samples from \nthe company’s employees.  \nb. Covered Employees have potential for exposure, and  \nc. At least one of the following is true:  \ni. The chemical is covered by an e xpanded health standard.  \nii. The chemical is a carcinogen.  \niii. The chemical has poor warning properties.  \niv. The chemical has a high odor threshold (e. g. difficult to \ndetect by smell).  \nv. The chemical has an unusually low OEL, for example <1 \nppm or the mg/m3 equivalent (see the OSHA Technical \nManual, Section II, Chapter 1, Personal Sampling for Air \nContaminants, Appendix M, to convert between ppm and \nmg/m3).  \nvi. The chemical has a skin designation from an above OEL.  \nNote: The above decision policy is also available in Append ix C as a flowchart.  \n2. Self-monitoring is not required under the previous conditions IF one or more \nof the following conditions are met:  \na. Covered Employees are not in the immediate area where work is being \nconducted.  \nb. The chemical has a low volatility or is no t part of the process where it \nis easily aerosolized.  \nNote: If it is determined that self -monitoring is not required due to the above, the \nCovered Employee needs to document the specific reason in a location designated by the \nRA/Director (e.g., case file).   \n3. Covered Employees may self -monitor any time they decide it is warranted.  \n Self-Monitoring for Noise  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 27-203 In most situations, self -monitoring for noise is not required.  Real time self -\nmonitoring, e. g. a sound level meter, is required when noise levels may exce ed \nexpected levels; it is used to determine when hearing protection is not adequate and \nthe situation requires a change in location or proactive hearing protection.  Noise \nexposure data will provide the Covered Employee with real time information to \ndeterm ine the need for additional hearing protection or distance from the source \nbefore causing hearing loss.  Covered Employees may self -monitor for noise \nexposure any time they believe it is necessary.  \nCovered Employees will enter all noise exposure monitoring  data into OIS.  \n The OSHA Hearing Conservation Program requires the use of personal protective \nequipment (PPE) and Audiometric examinations.  Audiometric examinations are \nconducted during routine medical evaluations.  See OSHA SHMS Manual Chapter \n16, Heari ng Conservation Program, for additional information.  \n Self-Monitoring for Other Physical Hazards  \nCovered employees will perform monitoring for physical agents (e.g. radiation, \nthermal stress).  Covered employees will enter monitoring data results into OIS.  \n1. When Covered Employees encounter a situation where radiation or thermal \nstress is present, they will contact their supervisor to determine the need and \nappropriate method for self -monitoring.  \n2. Covered Employees may arrange for self -monitoring any time they believe it \nis necessary.  \nVI. Exposure Records  \n Exposure Records  \nAn “employee exposure record” is defined in 29 CFR 1910.1020 .  For purposes of \nthis Program, the information contained in the OIS self -sampling records constitutes \nan employee exposure record. The employee exposure record shall be recorded as \noutlined in Appendix B.  \n Access to Exposure Records  \nCovered Employees wil l have access to their own employee exposure records without \nthe need for submitting a formal, written request for the records.  \n Exposure Records Availability  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 27-204 1. Under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. §552, exposure \nmonitoring records, regardles s of where they are stored or maintained, might \nbe released in response to requests from various parties.  In most cases, the \nCovered Employee’s name and Compliance Safety and Health Officer \n(CSHO) ID number will be redacted, based on Exemption 6 (informat ion \nabout specific individuals in “personnel and medical files and similar files” \nwhen the disclosure of such information would constitute a clearly \nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy) and/or Exemption 7(c) (records or \ninformation compiled for law en forcement purposes to the extent that such \ninformation could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted \ninvasion of personal privacy) of the Freedom of Information Act.  \n2. The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. §552a, is not generally applicable to \nestabl ishment case files. The Privacy Act permits an individual to seek access \nto only his/her own records and only if that record is maintained by the \nAgency within a system of records and retrieved by the individual requester’s \nname or personal identifiers.  \n3. If an inspection case is contested, exposure monitoring information might be \nreleased during the discovery process.  Exposure monitoring information \nwould be made accessible to the parties involved in the litigation (the \nestablishment inspected and, if they have elected party status, the union \nrepresenting the employees at the establishment), their attorneys and the \njudge. Under discovery, it is unlikely that the covered employee’s name or \nCSHO ID number could be redacted.  \nVII. Exposure Follow -Up \n During a site visit, if covered employees recognize that they may be overexposed, \nthey will take appropriate steps to remove themselves from risk and minimize further \nexposure.  The primary action following such an exposure is to implement controls to \nreduce or prevent additional exposure.   \n Covered Employees will notify their manager, who will notify the applicable OSHA \nField SHMS SHC whenever there is a known or suspected overexposure, see Chapter \n2, Safety and Health Management System, Section IV, Incide nt \nReporting/Investigation Procedures.  \n The applicable SHC will review any known or suspected exposure incident and \ndetermine if the case should be referred to the Director of OOMN, who will \ndetermine the need for further medical evaluation.  Medical survei llance may be \nprovided to employees exposed at levels greater than established occupational \nexposure limits or experiencing signs and symptoms of exposure as determined by \nOOMN.  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 27-205 \n The applicable SHC may make recommendations regarding current and future use o f \nappropriate personal protective equipment, administrative controls, and work \npractices to the appropriate OSHA management.  \nVIII.  Training  \nAll Covered Employees must receive training annually on:  \n The requirements contained in this Program.  \n Exposure data collect ion methods, data collection equipment.  \n Trends and lessons learned from the applicable SHC annual review.  \n The specific substances referenced in Appendix A, Chemical Exposure Hazards to \nensure familiarity and provide references on where to obtain additional  information.  \n How to enter self -monitoring data into OIS.  \nAdditional training is necessary if conditions such as data collection methods change.  \nRetraining will occur when the supervisor determines that a Covered Employee does not \npossess adequate unders tanding or skill to self -monitor and/or prevent exposure to \nhazardous chemicals.  \nIX. Data Tracking and Retention  \nCovered Employee exposure records are established and entered into OIS.  Appendix B, \nCreating a CSHO Sampling Record - OIS Instructions, is detailed and includes screen \nshots for correctly completing the form and accessing records in OIS.  A paper file nee d \nnot be created because the electronic records are maintained in OIS for the required 30 \nyears. See 29 CFR 1910.1020(d)(i)(ii) .  CSHOs may create paper copies for the ir own \nrecords.  \n \n  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 27-206 APPENDIX A  \nCHEMICAL EXPOSURE HAZARDS  \nI.

The Area Office \nestablishment should have been previously created and all CSHO sampling records should use \nthat establishment.  \nCreating a CSHO Sampling Record  \nMost CSHO sampling records are associated with an inspection.  Enter the associated inspection \nfirst, and then enter the sampling record inspection (ATAR inspecti on). \nGenerate a new inspection in OIS.  Use the previously created establishment for your office.  It is \nimportant that CSHO sampling records for each office be associated with the same area office \nestablishment record.  If you believe an establishment has  not been created for your office, \nrequest the system admin or designated person create an establishment for your office using the \nguidelines in the section below “Creating an Area Office Establishment in OIS”  \nSite Info Tab  \nSelect the “Search” button in th e “Establishment Information” section.  \nIn the “Establishment Name/DBA Name” field, enter USDOL%.  (You may enter state, county, \ncity or other criteria to narrow the search.).  \nAlternatively, if you know the OIS Establishment ID for your area office, you may  search for \nthat ID number.  \nHighlight your area office establishment and click the “Select Establishment” button.  If there are \nduplicate establishments for your area office, notify your supervisor or system administrator so \nthey can initiate an establishm ent clean -up according to established procedures.  \nParent Company Information:   BLANK  \nSite Address:  The site address of the associated inspection where the self -\nsampling took place.  \nSite Information  \nSite Activity:    The main employee activity sampled.  \nTemporary/Fixed:   Temporary  \nNAICS:    926150  \nEmployment Information:  \nEmployed in Estab:   Number of OSHA employees in your office.  \nCovered by Inspection:  Zero (No inspection must have zero covered employees)  \nControlled by Employer:  99999  \nEmployees Walk Aroun d: No \nEmployees Interviewed:  No \nUnion:     Yes \nCurrent Federal Contractor:  No \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 27-3 Related Activities Tab  \nMulti -Employer Inspections:  Add all inspections associated with the sampling \nperformed.  There is normally at least one inspection \nassociated – the inspect ion associated with the employee \nsampling performed by the CSHO that initiated the self -\nsampling.  \nInspection Dates Tab  \n Inspection dates for CSHO sampling should be the same as \nthe associated employer inspection dates and times.  \nInspection Type Tab  \nInitiating Type:  Other -ATARs  \nSecondary Types:  NONE  \nEmphasis Programs  ALL BLANK  \nInspection Category:  Appropriate to the discipline of the CSHO  \nSampling Performed:  Yes \nScope of Inspection:  No Inspection  \nReason No Inspection:  Other  \nExplanation:  CSHO Self -Samp ling \nStrategic Plan Activity:  BLANK  \nContact Info Tab  \nEmployees Contacted:  Add all names of OSHA employees sampled during this \nsampling session.  Normally, the job title will be “CSHO”  \nOIS Sampling Sheets  \nComplete OIS sampling sheets according to established guidelines.  CSHO self -sampling is \nnormally a one -time exposure.  In this normal case, use the following information for the \nEmployee/Area Record:  \nSampled Subject : Enter first and last name of OSHA employee sampled – \naddress information is not required.  \nSampled Employee Job  \nNumber of Employees Exposed:  Number of OSHA employees involved in sampling  \nJob Title:  CSHO or other appropriate title  \nOccupation Title:  INSPECTORS AND COMPLIANCE OFFICERS \nEXCEPT CONSTR.  \nExposure of person monitored:  Not Typic al \nExplain:  CSHO Self -Monitoring  \nFrequency:  Single Exposure (normally)  \nExposure Duration:  Length of sampling with appropriate Unit for Duration  \n \n \n \nCreating an Area Office Establishment in OIS  \n \nThis is a one-time step  and should be completed by one person i n the office —e.g., the system \nadministrator or other designated person.  It is important to complete this step prior to entering \nCSHO sampling data as all inspections entered will use the same establishment to facilitate ease \nof tracking and data collectio n.  Office managers and supervisors should be familiar with the \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 27-4 Area Office establishment. Once it is created, this file will help new staff create CSHO Sampling \nRecords and also help Regional Safety and Health Committee personnel when data is needed for \ncommittee review.  \n \nTHIS STEP IS ONLY DONE ONCE PER OFFICE.  \n \nFirst search to ensure an establishment has not already been created.  From the main OIS screen, \nclick “Search Establishment”.  Enter the search criteria:  \n \n“USDOL%” in the “Name” field.  \n \nIn the “Address” section, select the appropriate State, County, and/or City to narrow the search.  \nThere should be only one establishment for each Area Office to ensure all sampling records for a \nparticular office are accurately recorded.  If an OIS establishment record for your office has \nalready been created, use or modify that establishment.  If multiple establishments have been \ncreated for your area office, clean up the establishment records so that only one record remains \nand is used by all staff.  \n \nIf an estab lishment record has not been created  for your office, click the Create Establishment  \nbutton from the search screen:  \n \n \nEnter the information for your office:  \n \nEstablishment Name:     “USDOL OSHA”  \nDoing Business as Name:   Your Office Name; e.g., “Boise Area  Office”  \nFederal EIN:     530199187  \nNAICS:     926150  \nBusiness & Mailing Address:   Your office  business and mailing address.  \n     These are normally the same address.  \nOwnership Type:    Federal Government  \nLegal Establishment Type:   LEAVE BLANK  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 27-5 Federal Agency  Code:   1102 – OSHA  \nLeave other fields at their default value.  \n \n \n \nWhen finished, click Save.  \n  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 27-6 APPENDIX C  \nSITE VISIT CHEMICAL SELF -MONITORING DECISION FLOW CHART  \n \n \n1See section V.A.2.  \n2 For chemicals with poor warning properties, high odor, or low OELs, see Appendix A  \n  \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only.\n \n 27-7 APPENDIX D  \nPASSIVE SAMPLERS  \nBelow is a partial list of chemicals that may be sampled using passive samplers.  \nOSHA Va lidated Methods  \n2-Butanone (methyl ethyl ketone, MEK)  \nBenzene  \nEthyl benzene  \nHexone (methyl isobutyl ketone [MIBK])  \nHydrogen cyanide  \nIsobutyl acetate  \nMethyl ethyl ketone (2 -butanone)  \nMethyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), (hexone)  \nm-Xylene  \nn-Butyl acetate  \nNitrous oxide  \no-Xylene  \nPerchloroethylene (tetrachloroethylene)  \np-Xylene  \nsec-Butyl acetate  \nStyrene  \nt-Butyl acetate  \nTetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene)  \nToluene  \nTrichloroethylene  \n \n \n Manufacturer Validated Methods  \n1,2-Dichloroethene (1,2 -dichloroethylene)  \n1-Bromop ropane (propyl bromide)  \n1-Methylcyclohexanol  \nAcetone  \nAcrylonitrile  \nBenzene  \nDichloromethane (methylene chloride)  \nEthyl methacrylate  \nEthylene oxide  \nHalothane  \nIsoflurane  \nMethyl acrylate  \nMethyl t -butyl ether (MTBE)  \nMethylene chloride (dichloromethane)  \nn-Butyl acetate  \nn-Pentane  \nPerchloroethylene (tetrachloroethylene)  \nPropyl bromide (1 -bromopropane)  \nStyrene  \nt-Butyl methyl ether (MTBE)  \nTetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene)  \nTrichloroethylene  \nVinyl acetate  \n \n \n \n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This is an OSHA ARCHIVE Document, and may no longer represent OSHA policy.\n* OSHA ARCHIVE DOCUMENT * \nNOTICE: This document is presented here as historical content, for research and review purposes only."

\nIntroduction\nINTRODUCTION\nTraining Requirements for Workplace Safety \nUnder the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 , employers are responsible for \nproviding a safe and healthful workplace. No person should ever have to be injured, \nbecome ill, or die for a paycheck. \nOSHA ’s mission is to ensure the protection of workers and prevent work-related injuries, \nillnesses, and deaths by setting and enforcing standards, and by providing training, \noutreach, education and assistance. Many OSHA standards, which have prevented \ncountless workplace tragedies, include explicit safety and health training requirements \nto ensure that workers have the required skills and knowledge to safely do their work. \nThese requirements reflect OSHA ’s belief that training is an essential part of every \nemployer’s safety and health program for protecting workers from injuries and illnesses. \nResearchers conclude that those who are new on the job have a higher rate of injuries \nand illnesses than more experienced workers.\nTo assist employers, safety and health professionals, training directors and others with a \nneed to know, OSHA ’s training-related requirements have been excerpted and collected \nin this updated booklet. Requirements for posting information, warning signs, labels, \nand the like are excluded, as are most references to the qualifications of people assigned \nto test workplace conditions or equipment.  \nTraining in the safe way for workers to do their jobs well is an investment that will pay \nback over and over again in fewer injuries and illnesses, better morale, lower insurance \npremiums and more. \nIt is a good idea to keep a record of all safety and health training. Documentation can \nalso supply an answer to one of the first questions an incident investigator will ask: \n“Did the employee receive adequate training to do the job?”\n2 Training Requirements in OSHA Standards\n \nOSHA Standards: Protection on the Job \nOSHA Standards: Protection on the Job \nIn this booklet, the training requirements contained in OSHA ’s standards are organized \ninto five categories of OSHA standards: General Industry, Maritime, Construction, \nAgriculture, and Federal Employee Programs. An example of a training requirement \nis found in the revised Hazard Communication standard (Title 29 Code of Federal \nRegulations, Part 1910.1200, effective May 25, 2012), which improves the quality and \nconsistency of hazard information in the workplace. This standard states:  \nEmployers shall provide employees with effective information and \ntraining on hazardous chemicals in their work area at the time of \ntheir initial assignment, and whenever a new chemical hazard the \nemployees have not previously been trained about is introduced into \ntheir work area. Information and training may be designed to cover \ncategories of hazards (e.g., flammability, carcinogenicity) or specific \nchemicals. Chemical-specific information must always be available \nthrough labels and safety data sheets.\nThis booklet identifies the training requirements in specific OSHA standards. For \ninformation on training techniques and resources for developing training programs, \nplease see Resource for Development and Delivery of Training to Workers . \nInjury and Illness Prevention Programs\nTraining and education are elements of a strong injury and illness prevention program \nthat can help employers find and fix workplace hazards before workers get hurt. \nInjury and illness prevention programs are systems that can substantially reduce \nthe number and severity of workplace injuries and illnesses while reducing costs to \nemployers. Thousands of employers across the United States already manage safety \nusing injury and illness prevention programs, and OSHA believes that all employers can \nand should do the same. Thirty-four states have requirements or voluntary guidelines \nfor workplace injury and illness prevention programs. \nMost successful injury and illness prevention programs are based on a common set \nof key elements. These include management leadership, worker participation, hazard \nidentification, hazard prevention and control, education and training, and program \nevaluation and improvement. Visit OSHA ’s Injury and Illness Prevention Programs web \npage at www.osha.gov/dsg/topics/safetyhealth  for more information.\nTraining Requirements in OSHA Standards 3 \nIntroduction\nEducational Information\nOSHA has many types of educational materials in English, Spanish, Vietnamese and \nother languages available in print or online. These include:\n• Brochures/booklets;\n• Fact Sheets;\n• Guidance documents that provide detailed examinations of specific safety \nand health issues;\n• Online Safety and Health Topics pages;\n• Posters;\n• Small, laminated QuickCards™ that provide brief safety and health \ninformation; and\n• QuickTakes , OSHA ’s free, twice-monthly online newsletter with the latest \nnews about OSHA initiatives and products to assist employers and workers \nin finding and preventing workplace hazards. To sign up for QuickTakes , visit \nwww. osha.gov /quicktakes .\nTo view materials available online or for a listing of free publications, visit www.osha.gov/\npublications . Y ou can also call 1-800-321-OSHA (6742) to order publications.\nOSHA ’s web site also has information on job hazards and injury and illness prevention for \nemployers and workers. To learn more about OSHA ’s safety and health resources online, \nvisit www.osha.gov  or www.osha.gov/html/a-z-index.html .\nOSHA Training Institute (OTI) Education Centers\nOTI Education Centers  are nonprofit organizations authorized by OSHA to deliver \noccupational safety and health training to workers, supervisors and employers. These \norganizations are selected through a competitive process based on various criteria, \nincluding their occupational safety and health training experience, location and training \nfacilities, and ability to provide training throughout a given region. \nThe OTI Education Centers offer courses and seminars on a variety of safety and health \ntopics. They also contribute to the OSHA training mission through other safety and \nhealth programs, including community outreach efforts, courses offered in Spanish, and \nvarious youth initiatives. \nThe OTI Education Centers also support the Voluntary OSHA Outreach Training \nProgram by offering trainer courses and processing trainer requests for course \ncompletion cards. The Outreach Training Program is a voluntary program that is not \n4 Training Requirements in OSHA Standards\n \nWorker Participation in Developing Training Programs\nrequired by OSHA—nor does it fulfill any OSHA requirements. Still the outreach \nprogram can provide basic safety and health information and education. However, \nunder the OSHA law, all required training must be provided by and paid for by \nemployers. Through the outreach program, safety professionals can become authorized \nto deliver 10-hour and 30-hour classes on the recognition, avoidance, abatement, and \nprevention of safety and health hazards in workplaces. The program also provides \ninformation about workers’ rights, employer responsibilities, and how to file a \ncomplaint. It is important to note that this is a voluntary program and does not meet \ntraining requirements for any OSHA standards .  Although some states, municipalities, \nor organizations may require outreach training as a condition of employment, it is not \nan OSHA requirement. None of the courses within the Outreach Training Program is \nconsidered a certification.\nFor more information, including course descriptions and prerequisites, class schedules, \ntuition and fees, and featured organizations, visit OSHA ’s website: www.osha.gov/otiec . \nWorker Participation in Developing Training Programs\nTraining programs help ensure that safe jobs are no accident . Safe jobs exist because \nemployers make a conscious decision, each and every day of the year, to make \nprotecting workers a priority in the workplace. When this effort includes participation \nfrom workers, workplace injury and illness prevention programs are improved because \nworkers can identify missing safety procedures, make recommendations for changes and \nhelp ensure a safe workplace. When workers have a voice in the workplace and input \nabout how training is developed, training programs are more accurately focused on \nspecific workplace hazards.\nReaders with questions concerning worker safety and health training should contact \ntheir OSHA Regional or Area office listed at the end of this publication and on OSHA ’s \nwebsite: www.osha.gov . \nTraining Requirements in OSHA Standards  5\nTRAINING REQUIREMENTSPhoto: Sheryl Quatermas, New Jersey State Plan\nGeneral Industry\nThe following training requirements have been excerpted from Title 29, Code of \nFederal Regulations Part 1910.

E mergency response training. \nFederal OSHA standards in 29 CFR 1910.120(q) are directed toward private sector emergency responders. Therefore, the guidelines provided in this portion of the \nappendix are directed toward that employee population. However, they also impact \nindirectly through State OSHA or USEPA regulations some public sector emergency \nresponders. Therefore, the guidelines provided in this portion of the appendix may be \napplied to both employee populations.\nStates with OSHA state plans must cover their employees with regulations at \nleast as effective as the Federal OSHA standards. Public employees in states \nwithout approved state OSHA programs covering hazardous waste operations and \nemergency response are covered by the U.S. EPA under 40 CFR 311, a regulation \nvirtually identical to §1910.120.\nSince this is a non-mandatory appendix and therefore not an enforceable standard, \nOSHA recommends that those employers, employees or volunteers in public sector \nemergency response organizations outside Federal OSHA jurisdiction consider the following criteria in developing their own training programs. A unified approach to \ntraining at the community level between emergency response organizations covered \nby Federal OSHA and those not covered directly by Federal OSHA can help ensure \nan effective community response to the release or potential release of hazardous \nsubstances in the community.\nTraining Requirements in OSHA Standards  43 \nTraining Requirements\na. General considerations.\nEmergency response organizations are required to consider the topics listed in \n§1910.120(q)(6). Emergency response organizations may use some or all of the following topics to supplement those mandatory topics when developing their \nresponse training programs. Many of the topics would require an interaction \nbetween the response provider and the individuals responsible for the site where \nthe response would be expected.\n(1) H azard recognition, including:\n(A) N ature of hazardous substances present,\n(B) P ractical applications of hazard recognition, including presentations on \nbiology, chemistry, and physics.\n(2)  P rinciples of toxicology, biological monitoring, and risk assessment.\n(3)  Sa fe work practices and general site safety.\n(4)  En gineering controls and hazardous waste operations.\n(5)  S ite safety plans and standard operating procedures.\n(6)  D econtamination procedures and practices.\n(7)  Em ergency procedures, first aid, and self-rescue.\n(8)  Sa fe use of field equipment.\n(9)  S torage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous substances.\n(10) Use, care, and limitations of personal protective equipment.\n(11) Safe sampling techniques.\n(12) Rights and responsibilities of employees under OSHA and other related laws \nconcerning right-to-know, safety and health, compensations and liability.\n(13) Medical monitoring requirements.\n(14) Community relations.\nb.

Training \nIt is important that employees be trained in the recognition and prevention of hazards \nassociated with grain facilities, especially those hazards associated with their own work \ntasks. Employees should understand the factors which are necessary to produce a fire \nor explosion, i.e., fuel (such as grain dust), oxygen, ignition source, and (in the case of \nexplosions) confinement. Employees should be made aware that any efforts they make to \nkeep these factors from occurring simultaneously will be an important step in reducing \nthe potential for fires and explosions. \nThe standard provides flexibility for the employer to design a training program which \nfulfills the needs of a facility. The type, amount, and frequency of training will need \nto reflect the tasks that employees are expected to perform. Although training is to \nbe provided to employees at least annually, it is recommended that safety meetings or \ndiscussions and drills be conducted at more frequent intervals. \nThe training program should include those topics applicable to the particular facility, \nas well as topics such as: Hot work procedures; lock-out/tag-out procedures; bin entry \nprocedures; bin cleaning procedures; grain dust explosions; fire prevention; procedures for \nhandling “hot grain”; housekeeping procedures, including methods and frequency of dust \nremoval; pesticide and fumigant usage; proper use and maintenance of personal protective \nequipment; and, preventive maintenance. The types of work clothing should also be considered in the program at least to caution against using polyester clothing that easily \nmelts and increases the severity of burns, as compared to wool or fire retardant cotton. \nIn implementing the training program, it is recommended that the employer utilize \nfilms, slide-tape presentations, pamphlets, and other information which can be obtained \nfrom such sources as the Grain Elevator and Processing Society, the Cooperative \nExtension Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Kansas State University’s Extension Grain Science and Industry, and other state agriculture schools, industry \nassociations, union organizations, and insurance groups.\nTraining Requirements in OSHA Standards  79 \nTraining Requirements\nSubpart S – Electrical Safety-Related Work Practices\n1910.332  Training\n(a) Scope  .

The employer shall thoroughly instruct employees in \nthe safe use of fuel gas, as follows:\n(1) Before connecting a regulator to a cylinder valve, the valve \nshall be opened slightly and closed immediately. (This action is \ngenerally termed “cracking” and is intended to clear the valve of dust or dirt that might otherwise enter the regulator.) The person cracking the valve shall stand to one side of the outlet, not in front of it. The valve of a fuel gas cylinder shall not be cracked where the gas would reach welding work, sparks, flame or other possible sources of ignition.\n(2) The cylinder valve shall always be opened slowly to prevent \ndamage to the regulator. To permit quick closing, valves on fuel gas cylinders shall not be opened more than 1-1/2 turns. When a special wrench is required, it shall be left in position on the stem of the valve while the cylinder is in use so that the fuel gas flow can be shut off quickly in case of an emergency. In the case of manifolded or coupled cylinders, at least one such wrench shall always be available for immediate use. Nothing shall be placed on top of a fuel gas cylinder, when in use, which may damage the safety device or interfere with the quick closing of the valve.\n(3) Fuel gas shall not be used from cylinders through torches or \nother devices which are equipped with shutoff valves without reducing the pressure through a suitable regulator attached to the cylinder valve or manifold.\n(4) Before a regulator is removed from a cylinder valve, the cylinder \nvalve shall always be closed and the gas released from the regulator.\n(5) If, when the valve on a fuel gas cylinder is opened, there is found \nto be a leak around the valve stem, the valve shall be closed and the gland nut tightened. If this action does not stop the leak, the use of the cylinder shall be discontinued, and it shall be properly tagged and removed from the vessel. In the event that fuel gas should leak from the cylinder valve rather than from the valve stem and the gas cannot be shut off, the cylinder shall be properly tagged and removed from the vessel. If a regulator attached to a cylinder valve will effectively stop a leak through the valve seal, the cylinder need not be removed from the vessel.\n(6) If a leak should develop at a fuse plug or other safety device, the \ncylinder shall be removed from the vessel.(d)(1) \nthrough (6)\n118  Training Requirements in OSHA Standards \nMaritime\n1915.56  Ar c welding and cutting\n(d) Operating instructions  .

Refresher training shall be provided at \nleast every three years, and more often if necessary, to each \nemployee involved in operating a process to assure that the \nemployee understands and adheres to the current operating \nprocedures of the process. The employer, in consultation with the \nemployees involved in operating the process, shall determine the \nappropriate frequency of refresher training.\n(3) Training documentation. The employer shall ascertain that \neach employee involved in operating a process has received \nand understood the training required by this paragraph.

Examples presented in this appendix are not the \nonly means of achieving the performance goals in the standard. This appendix neither \nadds nor detracts from the requirements of the standard.\n2 .  E mployee Involvement in Process Safety Management . Section 304 of the Clean \nAir Act Amendments states that employers are to consult with their employees and their representatives regarding the employers’ efforts in the development \nand implementation of the process safety management program elements and \nhazard assessments. Section 304 also requires employers to train and educate \ntheir employees and to inform affected employees of the findings from incident \ninvestigations required by the process safety management program. Many \nemployers, under their safety and health programs, have already established means and methods to keep employees and their representatives informed about relevant \nsafety and health issues and employers may be able to adapt these practices and \nprocedures to meet their obligations under this standard. Employers who have not \nimplemented an occupational safety and health program may wish to form a safety \nand health committee of employees and management representatives to help the \nemployer meet the obligations specified by this standard. These committees can \nbecome a significant ally in helping the employer to implement and maintain an effective process safety management program for all employees.\n3 .  P rocess Safety Information . Complete and accurate written information \nconcerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is \nessential to an effective process safety management program and to a process \nhazards analysis. The compiled information will be a necessary resource to a \nvariety of users including the team that will perform the process hazards analysis \nas required under paragraph (e); those developing the training programs and \nthe operating procedures; contractors whose employees will be working with the \nprocess; those conducting the pre-startup reviews; local emergency preparedness planners; and insurance and enforcement officials.\nTraining Requirements in OSHA Standards  155 \nTraining Requirements\n5 .  O perating Procedures and Practices\n …O perating procedures and instructions are important for training operating \npersonnel. The operating procedures are often viewed as the standard operating \npractices (SOPs) for operations. Control room personnel and operating staff, in \ngeneral, need to have a full understanding of operating procedures. If workers are not \nfluent in English then procedures and instructions need to be prepared in a second \nlanguage understood by the workers. In addition, operating procedures need to \nbe changed when there is a change in the process as a result of the management of \nchange procedures. The consequences of operating procedure changes need to be fully \nevaluated and the information conveyed to the personnel. For example, mechanical changes to the process made by the maintenance department (like changing a valve \nfrom steel to brass or other subtle changes) need to be evaluated to determine if \noperating procedures and practices also need to be changed. All management of \nchange actions must be coordinated and integrated with current operating procedures \nand operating personnel must be oriented to the changes in procedures before the \nchange is made. When the process is shut down in order to make a change, then the \noperating procedures must be updated before startup of the process.\n T raining in how to handle upset conditions must be accomplished as well as what \noperating personnel are to do in emergencies such as when a pump seal fails or a pipeline ruptures. Communication between operating personnel and workers \nperforming work within the process area, such as nonroutine tasks, also must be \nmaintained. The hazards of the tasks are to be conveyed to operating personnel in \naccordance with established procedures and to those performing the actual tasks. \nWhen the work is completed, operating personnel should be informed to provide \nclosure on the job.\n6 .  E mployee Training . All employees, including maintenance and contractor \nemployees, involved with highly hazardous chemicals need to fully understand the safety and health hazards of the chemicals and processes they work with for \nthe protection of themselves, their fellow employees and the citizens of nearby \ncommunities. Training conducted in compliance with 1926.59, the Hazard \nCommunication standard, will help employees to be more knowledgeable about \nthe chemicals they work with as well as familiarize them with reading and \nunderstanding MSDS. However, additional training in subjects such as operating procedures and safety work practices, emergency evacuation and response, safety \nprocedures, routine and nonroutine work authorization activities, and other areas \npertinent to process safety and health will need to be covered by an employer’s \ntraining program.\n156  Training Requirements in OSHA Standards \nConstruction\n I n establishing their training programs, employers must clearly define the \nemployees to be trained and what subjects are to be covered in their training. \nEmployers in setting up their training program will need to clearly establish the \ngoals and objectives they wish to achieve with the training that they provide to their \nemployees. The learning goals or objectives should be written in clear measurable \nterms before the training begins. These goals and objectives need to be tailored \nto each of the specific training modules or segments. Employers should describe \nthe important actions and conditions under which the employee will demonstrate \ncompetence or knowledge as well as what is acceptable performance.\n H ands-on-training where employees are able to use their senses beyond listening, \nwill enhance learning. For example, operating personnel, who will work in a control room or at control panels, would benefit by being trained at a simulated \ncontrol panel or panels. Upset conditions of various types could be displayed on the \nsimulator, and then the employee could go through the proper operating procedures \nto bring the simulator panel back to the normal operating parameters. A training \nenvironment could be created to help the trainee feel the full reality of the situation \nbut, of course, under controlled conditions. This realistic type of training can be very \neffective in teaching employees correct procedures while allowing them to also see the consequences of what might happens if they do not follow established operating \nprocedures. Other training techniques using videos or on-the-job training can also \nbe very effective for teaching other job tasks, duties, or other important information. \nAn effective training program will allow the employee to fully participate in the \ntraining process and to practice their skill or knowledge.\n Em ployers need to periodically evaluate their training programs to see if the \nnecessary skills, knowledge, and routines are being properly understood and implemented by their trained employees. The means or methods for evaluating the \ntraining should be developed along with the training program goals and objectives. \nTraining program evaluation will help employers to determine the amount of \ntraining their employees understood, and whether the desired results were obtained. \nIf, after the evaluation, it appears that the trained employees are not at the level of \nknowledge and skill that was expected, the employer will need to revise the training \nprogram, provide retraining, or provide more frequent refresher training sessions until the deficiency is resolved. Those who conducted the training and those who \nreceived the training should also be consulted as to how best to improve the training \nprocess. If there is a language barrier, the language known to the trainees should be \nused to reinforce the training messages and information.\n C areful consideration must be given to assure that employees including \nmaintenance and contract employees receive current and updated training. For \nexample, if changes are made to a process, impacted employees must be trained \nTraining Requirements in OSHA Standards  157 \nTraining Requirements\nin the changes and understand the effects of the changes on their job tasks (e.g., \nany new operating procedures pertinent to their tasks). Additionally, as already \ndiscussed the evaluation of the employee’s absorption of training will certainly \ninfluence the need for training.\n8 .  P re-Startup Safety\n …F or existing processes that have been shut down for turnaround, or modification, \netc., the employer must assure that any changes other than “replacement in kind” made to the process during shutdown go through the management of change \nprocedures. P&IDs will need to be updated as necessary, as well as operating \nprocedures and instructions. If the changes made to the process during shutdown \nare significant and impact the training program, then operating personnel as well \nas employees engaged in routine and nonroutine work in the process area may \nneed some refresher or additional training in light of the changes. Any incident \ninvestigation recommendations, compliance audits or PHA recommendations need to be reviewed as well to see what impacts they may have on the process before \nbeginning the startup.\n9 .  M echanical Integrity . Employers will need to review their maintenance programs \nand schedules to see if there are areas where “breakdown” maintenance is used rather than an on-going mechanical integrity program. Equipment used to process, \nstore, or handle highly hazardous chemicals needs to be designed, constructed, \ninstalled and maintained to minimize the risk of releases of such chemicals. This \nrequires that a mechanical integrity program be in place to assure the continued \nintegrity of process equipment. Elements of a mechanical integrity program \ninclude the identification and categorization of equipment and instrumentation, inspections and tests, testing and inspection frequencies, development of \nmaintenance procedures, training of maintenance personnel, the establishment of \ncriteria for acceptable test results, documentation of test and inspection results, and \ndocumentation of manufacturer recommendations as to meantime to failure for \nequipment and instrumentation.\n … A ppropriate training is to be provided to maintenance personnel to ensure that they \nunderstand the preventive maintenance program procedures, safe practices, and the proper use and application of special equipment or unique tools that may be required. \nThis training is part of the overall training program called for in the standard.\n158  Training Requirements in OSHA Standards \nConstruction\n11 .  M anaging Change\n … Em ployers may wish to develop a form or clearance sheet to facilitate the \nprocessing of changes through the management of change procedures. A typical \nchange form may include a description and the purpose of the change, the technical \nbasis for the change, safety and health considerations, documentation of changes for \nthe operating procedures, maintenance procedures, inspection and testing, P&IDs, \nelectrical classification, training and communications, pre-startup inspection, \nduration if a temporary change, approvals and authorization...\n12 .  I nvestigation of Incidents . Incident investigation is the process of identifying the \nunderlying causes of incidents and implementing steps to prevent similar events \nfrom occurring. The intent of an incident investigation is for employers to learn \nfrom past experiences and thus avoid repeating past mistakes. The incidents for \nwhich OSHA expects employers to become aware and to investigate are the types \nof events which result in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release. \nSome of the events are sometimes referred to as “near misses, ” meaning that a \nserious consequence did not occur, but could have.\n Em ployers need to develop in-house capability to investigate incidents that occur \nin their facilities. A team needs to be assembled by the employer and trained in the techniques of investigation including how to conduct interviews of witnesses, \nneeded documentation and report writing. A multi-disciplinary team is better \nable to gather the facts of the event and to analyze them and develop plausible \nscenarios as to what happened, and why. Team members should be selected on the \nbasis of their training, knowledge and ability to contribute to a team effort to fully \ninvestigate the incident. \n13 .  E mergency Preparedness . Each employer must address what actions employees \nare to take when there is an unwanted release of highly hazardous chemicals. Emergency preparedness or the employer’s tertiary (third) lines of defense are those \nthat will be relied on along with the secondary lines of defense when the primary \nlines of defense which are used to prevent an unwanted release fail to stop the \nrelease. Employers will need to decide if they want employees to handle and stop \nsmall or minor incidental releases. Whether they wish to mobilize the available \nresources at the plant and have them brought to bear on a more significant release. Or whether employers want their employees to evacuate the danger area and \npromptly escape to a preplanned safe zone area, and allow the local community \nemergency response organizations to handle the release. Or whether the employer \nwants to use some combination of these actions. Employers will need to select how \nTraining Requirements in OSHA Standards  159 \nTraining Requirements\nmany different emergency preparedness or tertiary lines of defense they plan to \nhave and then develop the necessary plans and procedures, and appropriately train \nemployees in their emergency duties and responsibilities and then implement these \nlines of defense…\n … I f the employer wants specific employees in the release area to control or stop \nthe minor emergency or incidental release, these actions must be planned for in advance and procedures developed and implemented. Preplanning for handling \nincidental releases for minor emergencies in the process area needs to be done, \nappropriate equipment for the hazards must be provided, and training conducted \nfor those employees who will perform the emergency work before they respond to \nhandle an actual release. The employer’s training program, including the Hazard \nCommunication standard training is to address the training needs for employees \nwho are expected to handle incidental or minor releases…\n …R esponders may be working under very hazardous conditions and therefore the \nobjective is to have them competently led by an on-scene incident commander and the commander’s staff, properly equipped to do their assigned work safely, and fully \ntrained to carry out their duties safely before they respond to an emergency. Drills, \ntraining exercises, or simulations with the local community emergency response \nplanners and responder organizations is one means to obtain better preparedness. \nThis close cooperation and coordination between plant and local community \nemergency preparedness managers will also aid the employer in complying with the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency’s Risk Management Plan criteria…\n14 .  C ompliance Audits . Employers need to select a trained individual or assemble a \ntrained team of people to audit the process safety management system and program. \nA small process or plant may need only one knowledgeable person to conduct \nan audit. The audit is to include an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of \nthe process safety management system and a field inspection of the safety and \nhealth conditions and practices to verify that the employer’s systems are effectively \nimplemented. The audit should be conducted or led by a person knowledgeable in \naudit techniques and who is impartial towards the facility or area being audited. The essential elements of an audit program include planning, staffing, conducting the \naudit, evaluation and corrective action, follow-up and documentation…\n … Th e selection of effective audit team members is critical to the success of the \nprogram. Team members should be chosen for their experience, knowledge, and \ntraining and should be familiar with the processes and with auditing techniques, \npractices and procedures…\n160  Training Requirements in OSHA Standards \nConstruction\n An effective audit includes a review of the relevant documentation and process \nsafety information, inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with all levels \nof plant personnel. Utilizing the audit procedure and checklist developed in the preplanning stage, the audit team can systematically analyze compliance with the provisions of the standard and any other corporate policies that are relevant. For example, the audit team will review all aspects of the training program as part of the overall audit. The team will review the written training program for adequacy of content, frequency of training, effectiveness of training in terms of its goals and objectives as well as to how it fits into meeting the standard’s requirements, documentation, etc. Through interviews, the team can determine the employee’s knowledge and awareness of the safety procedures, duties, rules, emergency response assignments, etc. During the inspection, the team can observe actual practices such as safety and health policies, procedures, and work authorization practices. This approach enables the team to identify deficiencies and determine where corrective actions or improvements are necessary.\n1926.65  Hazardous w aste operations and emergency response\n(a) Definitions\n(3) Qualified person  means a person with specific training, \nknowledge and experience in the area for which the person has the responsibility and the authority to control.\n(b) Safety and health program\nNote to (b): Safety and health programs developed and implemented to meet other Federal, state, or local regulations are considered acceptable in meeting this requirement if they cover or are modified to cover the topics required in this paragraph.

O ccupational Safety and Health Program  . Each hazardous waste site clean-up effort \nwill require an occupational safety and health program headed by the site coordinator \nor the employer’s representative. The purpose of the program will be the protection \nof employees at the site and will be an extension of the employer’s overall safety and \nhealth program. The program will need to be developed before work begins on the \nsite and implemented as work proceeds as stated in paragraph (b). The program is to facilitate coordination and communication of safety and health issues among \npersonnel responsible for the various activities which will take place at the site. It \nwill provide the overall means for planning and implementing the needed safety and \nhealth training and job orientation of employees who will be working at the site. The \nprogram will provide the means for identifying and controlling worksite hazards and \nthe means for monitoring program effectiveness. The program will need to cover \nthe responsibilities and authority of the site coordinator or the employer’s manager on the site for the safety and health of employees at the site, and the relationships \nwith contractors or support services as to what each employer’s safety and health \nresponsibilities are for their employees on the site. Each contractor on the site needs \nto have its own safety and health program so structured that it will smoothly interface \nwith the program of the site coordinator or principal contractor.\n A lso those employers involved with treating, storing or disposal of hazardous waste \nas covered in paragraph (p) must have implemented a safety and health program for their employees. This program is to include the hazard communication program \nrequired in paragraph (p)(1) and the training required in paragraphs (p)(7) and (p)\n(8) as parts of the employer’s comprehensive overall safety and health program. This \nprogram is to be in writing.\n E ach site or workplace safety and health program will need to include the following: \n(1) Policy statements of the line of authority and accountability for implementing \nthe program, the objectives of the program and the role of the site safety and health \nsupervisor or manager and staff; (2) means or methods for the development of \nprocedures for identifying and controlling workplace hazards at the site; (3) means or \nmethods for the development and communication to employees of the various plans, \nTraining Requirements in OSHA Standards  175 \nTraining Requirements\nwork rules, standard operating procedures and practices that pertain to individual \nemployees and supervisors; (4) means for the training of supervisors and employees \nto develop the needed skills and knowledge to perform their work in a safe and \nhealthful manner; (5) means to anticipate and prepare for emergency situations; and \n(6) means for obtaining information feedback to aid in evaluating the program and \nfor improving the effectiveness of the program. The management and employees \nshould be trying continually to improve the effectiveness of the program thereby \nenhancing the protection being afforded those working on the site.\n A ccidents on the site or workplace should be investigated to provide information on \nhow such occurrences can be avoided in the future. When injuries or illnesses occur on the site or workplace, they will need to be investigated to determine what needs \nto be done to prevent this incident from occurring again. Such information will \nneed to be used as feedback on the effectiveness of the program and the information \nturned into positive steps to prevent any recurrence. Receipt of employee suggestions \nor complaints relating to safety and health issues involved with site or workplace \nactivities is also a feedback mechanism that can be used effectively to improve the \nprogram and may serve in part as an evaluative tool(s).\n F or the development and implementation of the program to be the most effective, \nprofessional safety and health personnel should be used. Certified Safety Professionals, Board Certified Industrial Hygienists or Registered Professional Safety \nEngineers are good examples of professional stature for safety and health managers \nwho will administer the employer’s program.\n2 .  Training  . The training programs for employees subject to the requirements of \nparagraph (e) of this standard should address: the safety and health hazards \nemployees should expect to find on hazardous waste clean-up sites; what control \nmeasures or techniques are effective for those hazards; what monitoring procedures \nare effective in characterizing exposure levels; what makes an effective employer’s \nsafety and health program; what a site safety and health plan should include; hands \non training with personal protective equipment and clothing they may be expected \nto use; the contents of the OSHA standard relevant to the employee’s duties and function; and, employee’s responsibilities under OSHA and other regulations. \nSupervisors will need training in their responsibilities under the safety and health \nprogram and its subject areas such as the spill containment program, the personal \nprotective equipment program, the medical surveillance program, the emergency \nresponse plan and other areas.\n176  Training Requirements in OSHA Standards \nConstruction\n Th e training programs for employees subject to the requirements of paragraph (p) \nof this standard should address: the employer’s safety and health program elements \nimpacting employees; the hazard communication program; the medical surveillance \nprogram; the hazards and the controls for such hazards that employees need to know \nfor their job duties and functions. All require annual refresher training.\n Th e training programs for employees covered by the requirements of paragraph \n(q) of this standard should address those competencies required for the various levels of response such as: the hazards associated with hazardous substances; hazard \nidentification and awareness; notification of appropriate persons; the need for and use of \npersonal protective equipment including respirators; the decontamination procedures \nto be used; preplanning activities for hazardous substance incidents including the \nemergency reponse plan; company standard operating procedures for hazardous \nsubstance emergency responses; the use of the incident command system and other \nsubjects. Hands-on training should be stressed whenever possible. Critiques done after an incident which include an evaluation of what worked and what did not and how \ncould the incident be better handled the next time may be counted as training time.\n F or hazardous materials specialists (usually members of hazardous materials teams), \nthe training should address the care, use and/or testing of chemical protective \nclothing including totally encapsulating suits, the medical surveillance program, the \nstandard operating procedures for the hazardous materials team including the use of \nplugging and patching equipment and other subject areas.\n Officer s and leaders who may be expected to be in charge at an incident should be \nfully knowledgeable of their company’s incident command system. They should know where and how to obtain additional assistance and be familiar with the local district’s \nemergency response plan and the state emergency response plan.\n S pecialist employees such as technical experts, medical experts or environmental \nexperts that work with hazardous materials in their regular jobs, who may be sent to \nthe incident scene by the shipper, manufacturer or governmental agency to advise \nand assist the person in charge of the incident should have training on an annual \nbasis. Their training should include the care and use of personal protective equipment \nincluding respirators; knowledge of the incident command system and how they are \nto relate to it; and those areas needed to keep them current in their respective field as \nit relates to safety and health involving specific hazardous substances.\n Th ose skilled support personnel, such as employees who work for public works \ndepartments or equipment operators who operate bulldozers, sand trucks, backhoes, \netc., who may be called to the incident scene to provide emergency support \nTraining Requirements in OSHA Standards  177 \nTraining Requirements\nassistance, should have at least a safety and health briefing before entering the area \nof potential or actual exposure. These skilled support personnel, who have not been \na part of the emergency response plan and do not meet the training requirements, \nshould be made aware of the hazards they face and should be provided all necessary \nprotective clothing and equipment required for their tasks.\n Th ere are two National Fire Protection Association standards, NFPA 472—“Standard \nfor Professional Competence of Responders to Hazardous Material Incidents” \nand NFPA 471—“Recommended Practice for Responding to Hazardous Material \nIncidents, ” which are excellent resource documents to aid fire departments and \nother emergency response organizations in developing their training program \nmaterials. NFPA 472 provides guidance on the skills and knowledge needed for first \nresponder awareness level, first responder operations level, hazmat technicians, and \nhazmat specialist. It also offers guidance for the officer corp that will be in charge of \nhazardous substance incidents.\n9 .  N ew Technology and Spill Containment Programs  .\n …A ll workers performing hazardous substance spill control work are expected to \nwear the proper protective clothing and equipment for the materials present and to follow the employer’s established standard operating procedures for spill control. All \ninvolved workers need to be trained in the established operating procedures; in the \nuse and care of spill control equipment; and in the associated hazards and control of \nsuch hazards of spill containment work.\nAppendix [E] to 1926.65 — Training Curriculum Guidelines\nThe following non-mandatory  general criteria may be used for assistance in developing \nsite-specific training curriculum used to meet the training requirements of 29 CFR 1926.65(e); 29 CFR 1926.65(p)(7), (p)(8)(iii); and 29 CFR 1926.65(q)(6), (q)(7), and \n(q)(8).

E mergency response training\n  F ederal OSHA standards in 29 CFR 1926.65(q) are directed toward private sector \nemergency responders. Therefore, the guidelines provided in this portion of the appendix are directed toward that employee population. However, they also impact \nindirectly through State OSHA or USEPA regulations some public sector emergency \nresponders. Therefore, the guidelines provided in this portion of the appendix may \nbe applied to both employee populations.\n  S tates with OSHA state plans must cover their employees with regulations at least as \neffective as the Federal OSHA standards. Public employees in states without approved \nstate OSHA programs covering hazardous waste operations and emergency response are \ncovered by the U.S. EPA under 40 CFR 311, a regulation virtually identical to 1926.65.\n  S ince this is a non-mandatory appendix and therefore not an enforceable standard, \nOSHA recommends that those employers, employees or volunteers in public sector \nemergency response organizations outside Federal OSHA jurisdiction consider the \nfollowing criteria in developing their own training programs. A unified approach to \ntraining at the community level between emergency response organizations covered \nby Federal OSHA and those not covered directly by Federal OSHA can help ensure \nan effective community response to the release or potential release of hazardous \nsubstances in the community.\na.  G eneral considerations\n Em ergency response organizations are required to consider the topics listed in \n1926.65(q)(6). Emergency response organizations may use some or all of the \nfollowing topics to supplement those mandatory topics when developing their \nresponse training programs. Many of the topics would require an interaction \nbetween the response provider and the individuals responsible for the site where \nthe response would be expected.\n192  Training Requirements in OSHA Standards \nConstruction\n(1)  H azard recognition, including:\n(A)  N ature of hazardous substances present,\n(B)  P ractical applications of hazard recognition, including \npresentations on biology, chemistry, and physics.\n(2)  P rinciples of toxicology, biological monitoring, and risk assessment.\n(3)  Sa fe work practices and general site safety.\n(4)  En gineering controls and hazardous waste operations.\n(5)  S ite safety plans and standard operating procedures.\n(6)  D econtamination procedures and practices.\n(7)  Em ergency procedures, first aid, and self-rescue.\n(8)  Sa fe use of field equipment.\n(9)  S torage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous substances.\n(10) Use, care, and limitations of personal protective equipment.\n(11) Safe sampling techniques.\n(12) Rights and responsibilities of employees under OSHA and other related \nlaws concerning right-to-know, safety and health, compensations and \nliability.\n(13) Medical monitoring requirements.\n(14) Community relations.\nb.

The OSH Act encourages states to develop and operate \ntheir own job safety and health programs and precludes state enforcement of OSHA \nstandards unless the state has an approved program. OSHA approves and monitors \nall state plans and provides as much as fifty percent of the funding for each program. \nState-run safety and health programs must be at least as effective as the Federal OSHA \nprogram. To find the contact information for the OSHA Federal or state plan office nearest you, call 1-800-321-OSHA (6742) or go to www.osha.gov .\nThe following 22 states or territories have OSHA-approved state programs: \n• Alaska  \n• Arizona  \n• California \n• Hawaii \n• Indiana  \n• Iowa  • Kentucky \n• Maryland  \n• Michigan \n• Minnesota \n• Nevada \n• New Mexico • North Carolina \n• Oregon \n• Puerto Rico \n• South Carolina \n• Tennessee \n• Utah  • Vermont  \n• Virginia \n• Washington \n• Wyoming  \nFederal OSHA provides coverage to certain workers specifically excluded from a \nstate’s plan — for example, those in some states who work in maritime industries or \non military bases.\n252  Training Requirements in OSHA Standards\n \nAppendix C – States with Approved OSHA Plans\nState and Local Government Workers\nWorkers at state and local government agencies are not covered by Federal OSHA, \nbut have OSH Act protections if they work in those states that have an OSHA-approved \nstate program. \nOSHA rules also permit states and territories to develop plans that cover only public \nsector (state and local government) workers. In these cases, private sector workers and \nemployers remain under Federal OSHA jurisdiction. Five additional states and one U.S. \nterritory have OSHA-approved state plans that cover public sector workers only:\n• Connecticut\n• Illinois  • Maine\n• New Jersey• New York  \n• Virgin Islands   \n \nFederal Government Workers\nOSHA ’s protection applies to all federal agencies. Section 19 of the OSH Act makes \nfederal agency heads responsible for providing safe and healthful working conditions \nfor their workers. Although OSHA does not fine federal agencies, it does monitor \nthese agencies and conducts federal workplace inspections in response to workers’ \nreports of hazards.\nFederal agencies must have a safety and health program that meets the same standards \nas private employers. Under a 1998 amendment, the OSH Act covers the U.S. Postal Service the same as any private sector employer.\nNot Covered under the OSH Act\n• The self-employed;\n• Immediate family members of farm employers; and\n• Workplace hazards regulated by another federal agency (for example, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Energy, or Coast Guard).\nTraining Requirements in OSHA Standards  253 \nTraining Resources\nAppendix D – Free On-site Safety and Health Consultation \nServices for Small Business\nOSHA ’s On-site Consultation Program offers free and confidential advice to small and \nmedium-sized businesses in all states across the country, with priority given to high-\nhazard worksites. Each year, responding to requests from small business owners looking \nto create or improve their safety and health management programs, OSHA ’s On-site \nConsultation Program conducts over 29,000 visits to small business worksites covering \nover 1.5 million workers across the nation.\nOn-site consultation services are separate from enforcement and do not result in \npenalties or citations. Consultants from state agencies or universities work with \nemployers to identify workplace hazards, provide advice on compliance with OSHA \nstandards, and assist in establishing safety and health management programs.\nFor more information, to find the local On-site Consultation office in your state, or to \nrequest a brochure on Consultation Services, visit www.osha.gov/consultation, or call \n1-800-321-OSHA (6742).\nUnder the consultation program, certain exemplary employers may request \nparticipation in OSHA ’s Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program \n(SHARP). Eligibility for participation includes, but is not limited to, receiving a \nfull-service, comprehensive consultation visit, correcting all identified hazards and developing an effective safety and health management program. Worksites that receive \nSHARP recognition are exempt from programmed inspections during the period that \nthe SHARP certification is valid.\n254  Training Requirements in OSHA Standards\n \nAppendix E – NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluation Program\nAppendix E – NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluation Program\nGetting Help with Health Hazards\nThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is a federal agency \nthat conducts scientific and medical research on workers’ safety and health. At no cost \nto employers or workers, NIOSH can help identify health hazards and recommend \nways to reduce or eliminate those hazards in the workplace through its Health Hazard \nEvaluation (HHE) Program.\nWorkers, union representatives and employers can request a NIOSH HHE. An HHE \nis often requested when there is a higher-than-expected rate of a disease or injury in a group of workers. These situations may be the result of an unknown cause, a new \nhazard, or a mixture of sources. To request a NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluation go to \nwww.cdc.gov/niosh/hhe/request.html .

O ur intention is to make this information conveniently available to workers, employers,  \noccupational health professionals, and union representatives.\nBACKGROUND\nUnder the authority of the Occupational Safety and Health (O S H ) Act [29 U SC 1900] and the M ine Safety  \nand Health A ct [30 U SC 80], N IO S H  develops and recommends criteria for preventing disease and  \nhazardous conditions in the workplace. N IO S H  recommended exposure limits (R E Ls) are examples of such  \ncriteria. N IO S H  also recommends preventive measures (e.g., engineering controls, safe work practices,  \npersonal protective equipment, and environmental and medical monitoring) for reducing or eliminating the  \nadverse health effects of these hazards. To formulate these recommendations, N IO S H  evaluates ail relevant  \nscientific information about a given hazard. The recommendations are then transmitted to the Occupational  \nSafety and Health Administration (O S H A ) and the M ine Safety and H ealth Administration (M S H A ) of the  \nU.S. Department of Labor for use in promulgating legal standards. These recommendations are generally  \npublished in criteria documents, Current Intelligence Bulletins (C IB s), Alerts, Special Hazard Reviews,  \nOccupational Hazard Assessments, and responses to regulatory agencies (see page 2 for a description of  \nthese documents).\nSCOPE\nThis document contains two major sections, A  and B. Section A  lists all N IO S H  documents containing  \nrecommendations for chemical, physical, and other hazards in the workplace. Section B contains the N IO S H  \nRELs for all of these hazards as well as the adverse health effects for the chemical and physical hazards.\nFive appendices contain additional information about (1) classes of chemicals and (2) RELs adopted or  \nrevised during O SH A  rulemaking activity in 1988*\nSection A. Documents Containing NIOSH Recommendations for Safety and  \nHealth\nThis section lists all N IO S H  documents that contain recommendations for safety and health standards in the  \nworkplace. These documents are listed by publication date under the occupational hazard they discuss.\nEach occupational hazard is arranged alphabetically. The types of documents included are as follows:\n*This activity is referred to hereafter as the O SH A  P E L  Project. The final rule was published in the  \nFederal Register  on January 19, 1989 [54 FR  2329-2984 (1989)].\n1\n\nCompendium o f Policy Documents\n• N IO SH publications  (criteria documents, CIBs, Alerts, Special Hazard Reviews, Occupational\nHazard Assessments, and miscellaneous statements and reports)\n• Written testim ony  from N IO S H  about rules proposed by regulatory agencies such as O SH A , M S H A ,  \nor the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (E P A )\n•  Testimony presented by N IO SH  at regulatory hearings convened by O S H A  or M S H A\nThese documents are described here briefly and are available through N IO S H  or the National Technical  \nInform ation Service (N T IS ).’\nCriteria Documents . —C riteria documents are developed to provide the basis for the comprehensive  \noccupational safety and health standards sought by congress. These documents generally contain a critical  \nreview o f the scientific and technical information available on the prevalence of hazards, the existence of  \nsafety and health risks, and the adequacy o f methods to identify and control hazards. Recommendations for  \nminimizing safety and health risks include medical monitoring, exposure assessment, worker training, control  \ntechnology, personal protective equipment, and recordkeeping as well as RELs where appropriate. C riteria  \ndocuments are developed prim arily for the U.S. Departm ent of Labor (O S H A  and M S H A ); however, they  \nare also distributed to health professionals in academia, industry, organized labor, public interest groups, and  \nother Federal, State, and local government agencies.\nCurrent intelligence Bulletins (CIBs).  —CIBs review and evaluate new and emerging information about  \noccupational hazards. A  C1B may draw attention to a previously unrecognized hazard, report new data on a  \nknown hazard, or disseminate information about hazard control. These documents are distributed to  \nrepresentatives of academia, industry, organized labor, public health agencies, and public interest groups as  \nwell as to Federal agencies responsible for ensuring the safety and health of workers.\nAlerts.  —N IO S H  Alerts briefly present new information about occupational illnesses, injuries, and deaths.  \nAlerts urgently request assistance in preventing, solving, and controlling newly identified occupational  \nhazards. Workers, employers, and safety and health professionals are asked to take immediate action to  \nreduce risks and implement controls.\nSpecial Hazard Re/views, Occupational Hazard Assessments, and Miscellaneous Statements  \nand Reports.  —Special Hazard Reviews, Occupational Hazard Assessments, and miscellaneous statements  \nand reports are other types of N IO S H  documents that complement N IO S H  recommendations for standards.  \nThese documents assess safety and health problems and recommend appropriate methods for control and  \nmonitoring. Although these documents do not supplant the more comprehensive criteria documents, they  \nare prepared to assist O S H A  or M S H A  in the formulation o f regulations.\nResponses  to Regulatory Agencies.  —N IO S H  periodically presents written comments and testimony  \nbefore Congressional committees and at regulatory hearings convened by O SH A  or M S H A . The testimony  \nalways includes the current N IO S H  policy concerning the hazard in question.\n’ National Technical Inform ation Service, Port Royal Road, Springfield, V A  22161.  \nOrder desk telephone: (703) 487-4650.\n2\n\nIntroduction\nSection B. NIOSH RELs and General Recommendations for Safety and Health\nThis section contains three tables listing occupational hazards and the N IO S H  RELs and general  \nrecommendations for safety and health. Table 1 lists chemical hazards, Table 2 presents physical hazards,  \nand Table 3 contains industry, process, and work environment hazards. Health effects cited in Tables 1 and  \n2 are those generally associated with the hazard; they are for humans unless otherwise noted. Consult the  \nprimary sources listed in Section A  for definitive information. The Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS)  \nnumber and the Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (R TE C S ) number are included in Table 1  \nwhere appropriate.\nAppendix I. Classes of Chemicals\nSeveral RELs apply to entire classes of chemicals. Appendix I  lists these classes (e.g., alkanes, ketones, etc.)  \nand the individual members of each that are listed by RTECS. Table 1 o f Section B refers the reader to  \nAppendix I  whenever a class name is mentioned. Readers may use the class name to locate source  \ndocuments in Section A .\nAppendix II. Chemicals for Which NIOSH Adopted RELs During the OSHA PEL  \nProject\nAppendix I I  lists chemicals for which N IO S H  adopted exposure limits on the basis of their comments during  \nthe O SH A  PEL Project. These RELs are included in Table I  of Section B. For further information about  \nthese chemicals, readers should refer to O SH A ’s final rule on air contaminants in the Federal Register  \n[54 FR 2641 (1989)] and to the 1988 N IO S H  testimony on O S H A ’s proposed rule on air contaminants [N TIS  \nNo. P B -9 1 -1 15-337].\nAppendix III. Chemicals for Which NIOSH Did Not Adopt RELs During the OSHA  \nPEL Project\nAppendix I I I  lists chemicals for which N IO S H  did not adopt RELs during the O SH A  PEL Project. A fter a  \nlimited review of these chemicals, N IO S H  concluded that adverse health effects could occur at the proposed  \nO SHA PELs.\nAppendix IV. Chemicals for Which NIOSH Revised Existing RELs During the  \nOSHA PEL Project\nAppendix IV  lists chemicals for which N IO S H  revised existing RELs during the O S H A  P E L  Project. These  \nchemicals are listed with their previous and current RELs.\nAppendix V. Categories of Pesticides\nAppendix V  lists pesticides according to three categories of toxicity defined in the 1978 N IO S H  criteria  \ndocument on pesticides (Criteria for a Recommended Standard: Occupational Exposure During the  Manufacturing and Formulation o f Pesticides , D H E W  (N IO S H ) Publication No. 78-174, N TIS No.\nP B -81-227-001). Many of the chemicals listed as pesticides have other applications and are presented in  \nSections A  and B.\n3\n\nSECTION A\nDOCUMENTS CONTAINING NIOSH  \nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR SAFETY AND HEALTH\nThis section lists all N IO S H  documents that contain recommendations for safety and health standards in the  \nworkplace.

Group I contains the pesticides that pose a significant risk of (1) adverse acute health effects at low concentrations, or (2) carcinogenic, teratogenic, neurotoxic, or reproductive effects. Group II pesticides pose adverse acute health risks at moderate doses, and Group m  pesticides pose minimal risk of adverse acute effects even at relatively high doses. For further discussion and clarification, refer to the 1978 NIOSH criteria document on pesticides (Criteria for a recommended standard: occupational exposure during the manufacturing and formulation of pesticides, DHEW (NIOSH) Publication No. 78-174, NTIS No. PB-81-227-001). Many of the chemicals listed as pesticides have other applications and are presented in Sections A and B.\nGROUP I PESTICIDES\nAcephate-met3-(alpha-AcetonyIfurfuryl)-4-hydroxycoumarin

Airmonitoring is an important activity that can help alert employerswhen unsafe levels of EtO are present in the air so that they cantake steps to reduce employee exposure. EtO can be used moresafely if appropriate precautions are taken and if equipment isadequately designed and maintained. This document:\nIClarifies the different types of EtO exposure monitoring,\nILists and explains the exposure levels used by OSHA,\nIReviews the exposure monitoring requirements in OSHA’s EtOrules, and\nIOutlines the monitoring decisions that the employer needs tomake when employees work in areas where EtO is present. \nAll of the required actions presented in this document are\nbased on OSHA’s EtO standard (29 CFR 1910.1047). This guidance\ndocument provides helpful suggestions for complying with§1910.1047 as well.\n3This guidance document is not a standard or regulation, and it\ncreates no new legal obligations. The guidance document isadvisory in nature, informational in content, and is intended toassist employers in providing a safe and healthful workplace.The Occupational Safety and Health Act requires employers tocomply with hazard-specific safety and health standardspromulgated by OSHA or by a State with an OSHA-approvedState Plan. In addition, pursuant to Section 5(a)(1), the GeneralDuty Clause of the Act, employers must provide their employeeswith a workplace free from recognized hazards likely to causedeath or serious physical harm. Employers can be cited forviolating the General Duty Clause if there is a recognized hazardand they do not take reasonable steps to prevent or abate thehazard. However, failure to implement these recommendations is not, in itself, a violation of the General Duty Clause. Citationscan only be based on standards, regulations, and the GeneralDuty Clause.\nBackground\nEtO is used extensively by hospitals and other industries as a\nsterilizing agent. EtO is a colorless, odorless gas which is bothflammable and highly reactive. Most importantly, you cannot smellEtO until it reaches levels that can cause serious harm to humanhealth (NIOSH, 1989). Human and animal studies consistently showthat EtO can be hazardous to human health. Short-term exposuresto EtO can cause respiratory irritation and lung injury, shortness ofbreath, headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Long-termexposure over many years may cause cancer, reproductive effects,genetic changes, and damage to the nervous system (Lamontagneet al., 1990).\nOSHA Requirement for Air Monitoring \nThe OSHA EtO standard requires employers to conduct personalmonitoring unless they are specifically exempt (see “Exemptions”text box at page 10). This guidance document is intended to helpemployers understand the difference between personal monitoring,area monitoring, and leak detection and why area monitoring iscomplementary to personal monitoring, but can never be usedinstead of it.\nClarifying the Different Types   \nof Exposure Monitoring \nThere are three types of EtO monitoring available for determining\nlevels of EtO in a workplace: 1) personal monitoring, 2) area moni-toring, and 3) leak detection (a special type of area monitoring).\nHowever, personal monitoring is required to determine if there is\ncompliance with the exposure limits of the standard.\n4\nPersonal Monitoring\nPersonal monitoring involves measuring a person’s exposure to\nEtO by testing the air that the person (an employee) would breatheregardless of where the person moves in the workplace. A samplingdevice is attached to the shirt collar or as close as practical to thenose and mouth of the employee in the employee’s “breathingzone” – the hemisphere forward of the shoulders with a radius ofapproximately six to nine inches – to test airborne EtO concentra-tions.\nThe device is worn for a specified period of time. During\npersonal monitoring for EtO, the sample is collected for 15 minutesto test short-term exposure or for the length of a whole work shift(typically 8 hours; see the text box “What if the Work Shift is NotExactly 8 Hours?” at page 8) to test for average exposures over thecourse of a workday. These air samples will be referred to here as15-minute samples and 8-hour samples.\nEquipment used for personal monitoring typically includes a\n“passive diffusion monitor” (a type of clip-on tag that collects EtO),or alternatively a small air pump worn on the employee’s belt thatpulls a sample of air through a glass tube filled with a substancethat captures EtO. These samples typically must be sent to alaboratory for analysis. The accuracy of any method depends to alarge degree upon the skills and experience of those who not onlycollect the samples but also those who analyze the samples.  \nAfter the samples have been analyzed, the employer must post\nmonitoring results within 15 days of receiving them, or notifyemployees of the results in writing. The employer must alsomention the steps being taken to reduce employee exposures whenthe monitoring results indicate that the time-weighted average orexcursion limit has been exceeded.\nArea Monitoring\nArea monitoring is used to show the levels of EtO throughout thegeneral working area and to identify problems and priorities.\nArea samples should be taken close to a source of emission in\norder to evaluate concentrations or the effectiveness of steps takento control exposure. Alternatively, area samples can be collected at\n5\nvarious places in the working area to assess how far EtO might\nhave spread. Equipment used for area monitoring is often mountedon the wall or placed directly on equipment. The monitoring instru-mentation can be similar to that used for personal monitoring, or itcan be of the “direct-reading” type, which gives an immediatereading of the EtO level.  When an employer uses direct readinginstruments, nothing needs to be sent to a laboratory but theequipment must be calibrated periodically to ensure accuracy.\nA wall-mounted emergency alert system used for area monitoring\nis one example of a direct-reading area monitor (also see subsectiontitled “Emergency Alert Provision” at page 18).\nLeak Detection \nEmployers, who are required to create a written complianceprogram because their employees’ exposures are over thepermissible exposure limit, must also produce a schedule forroutine leak detection surveys. Some businesses that use EtO find ithelpful to test equipment such as sterilizers, pipes, tanks, andfittings at least every two weeks to confirm that there are no leaks.Portable EtO gas-detection meters are available to check for leaksaround equipment such as sterilizers, tanks, fittings, and pipes thatcontain EtO. Leak testing is generally performed using hand-heldEtO detection meters (a type of portable direct-reading instrument). \nThe OSHA Exposure Levels\nThe Federal OSHA regulation on EtO establishes certain allowableexposure levels. This section will explain the terms, units, andexposure levels that require action.\nUnits of Measure: Exposure levels are reported as concentrations\n– the volume of EtO per volume of air. This is typically expressedas “parts per million” (also called “ppm”). One part per millionmeans that there is one part of EtO in every million parts of airsampled. Alternatively, the concentration of EtO can also bereported using metric units, in milligrams of EtO per cubic meter\n6\nof air (mg/m3). It is important to compare only exposure values\nthat have the same units of measure. For example, only compareexposure results reported as ppm to the OSHA levels for EtOreported in ppm.\nAction Level: The “action level” is the 8-hour exposure level\nthat triggers certain actions under OSHA’s EtO standard. If anemployee’s 8-hour sample result is equal to or greater than theaction level, the employer must start certain required activitiessuch as exposure monitoring and medical surveillance.\nThe action level for EtO is 0.5 ppm (which equals 0.9 mg/m\n3).\nActions an employer must take if the personal monitoring test\nresult is greater than, or equal to, the “action level” are outlined inthe subsection titled “Actions Triggered by Air Sample Results” atpage 15.\nPermissible Exposure Limit (PEL): This is the exposure level of\nEtO above which no employees may be exposed to undernormal workplace conditions.  You should become familiar withtwo PELs; one for 8-hour samples and one for 15-minutesamples.\nEight-Hour Time-Weighted Average (8-hour TWA) — This is\nan 8-hour (or full work shift) sample that represents themaximum average EtO levels that an employee should beexposed to. \nThe 8-hour PEL for EtO is 1 ppm (which equals 1.8 mg/m\n3).\nExcursion Limit (15-minute) — This is a 15-minute (short-\nterm) sample that represents the maximum EtO exposurelevel that an employee may be exposed to for a short periodof time.  \nRotating employees to different workstations so that they are\nnot exposed to higher EtO levels is not an accepted way ofmeeting the 8-hour TWA or the Excursion Limit requirement.\nThe 15-minute Excursion Limit for EtO is 5 ppm (equal to 9\nmg/m\n3).\nBoth types of samples are important because, taken together, they\nhelp employers protect employees over the range of exposure\n7\nconditions that employees are likely to experience. Actions that\nan employer must take if these PELs are exceeded are outlined inTables 3 and 4 at pages 15-17.\nWhat if the Work Shift is Not Exactly 8 Hours?\nWhen you collect an 8-hour sample, OSHA expects you to\ncollect the sample for the length of the whole work shift, nomatter how long it is. The shift might be more or less than 8hours. Although not every sample will be exactly 8 hours, theOSHA action level and 8-hour permissible exposure limitmust only be compared to an 8-hour sample result. \nTo avoid confusion caused by samples collected for more or\nless time, OSHA allows you to use a simple equation thatconverts any full-shift sample result to an 8 -hour equivalent\nresult (also called an 8-hour time-weighted average or an 8-\nhour TWA result).  \nEquation:\nC\n8= C A(TA)/T8\nTA = The actual time during which your sample was collected (in minutes).\nCA = The actual result (concentration) for your sample (in ppm).T8 = 480 minutes (this is the number of minutes in 8 hours).C8 = The 8-hour equivalent result for your sample (in ppm).\nFortunately, most analytical laboratories will do the calculation\nfor you. Ask the laboratory to “Report the full-shift results as8-hour time-weighted averages (or 8-hour TWAs).” You donot need to make this arrangement for 15-minute samples,which should always be collected for exactly 15 minutes. \nWhen exposure levels are high, it may be necessary to collect\na series of mid-length samples (for example, 1-2 hours each)instead of a single 8-hour sample for an employee. In thiscase, ask the laboratory to combine all the results from oneemployee to create a single 8-hour TWA result.\n8\nMonitoring Requirements\nIWhat types of monitoring are required to be in compliance\nwith OSHA’s EtO standard?\nThe OSHA EtO standard requires that each employer whose\nworkplace does not meet the “exemption” clause,§1910.1047(a)(2), must perform personal monitoring to showwhether EtO exposures are exceeding the 8-hour and/or the 15-minute PEL. The OSHA standard requires that these samples be“representative” of EtO exposures (see “Criteria for UsingResults from Similar Work Conditions” text box, at page 11). Thereare two types of monitoring requirements: initial and periodic .\nInitial Monitoring\nIDo I need to collect initial EtO samples?\nYes. If you are not exempt (see “Exemptions” text box at page 10)\nand there is reason to believe that exposure levels may equal or beabove the action level under “expected conditions of operation,”\nthen you are required to conduct personal EtO monitoring toaccurately measure the airborne concentrations of EtO. Mostemployers should assume that exposure levels may reach or\nexceed the action level and that they must conduct exposuremonitoring: 1) if their business involves processing, using, orhandling products containing EtO; 2) if they are not exempt asdescribed in the Exemption text box; and 3) if they have never\nconducted personal monitoring. \nThis level of caution is important because accidental releases of\nEtO may occur from several sources, including leaking cartridges,sterilizer discharge lines and leaks, or routine changing of EtOsupply cylinders. A relatively small quantity of EtO released intoan average office-sized space can result in concentrations thatare many times above the action level or PEL (NIOSH, 1989;Lamontagne and Kelsey 1998). If there are special circumstancesthat would suggest that monitoring is not required for yourworkplace and you need further clarification, we encourage you to\n9\ncontact your local area OSHA office. Locate your local area OSHA\noffice by phone at 1-800-321-OSHA or online at http://www.osha.gov/html/ RAmap.html.\nWhen carrying out initial monitoring, you must collect both 8-\nhour samples (full work shift) and 15-minute samples (short-term).\nAt least one sample of each type is required for:\n•  Each work shift, •  Each job classification, and •  In each work area of the workplace.\nExemptions\nIs Monitoring Always Required? No.An employer is exempt from the standard and, therefore,\nis not required to conduct employee exposure monitoring if“objective data” demonstrates the processing, use, orhandling of products containing EtO are not capable ofreleasing EtO in concentrations at or above the OSHA actionlevel or in excess of the excursion limit under expectedconditions that will cause the greatest possible release. \nThe objective data might include specific information\ngenerated by an individual employer or obtained fromchemical manufacturers, industry studies, or trade associa-tions that documents why your facility’s processing, use, orhandling of EtO would not result in workplace concentrationsexceeding the action level or excursion limit.\nObjective data records must be kept as long as the employer\nrelies on the data to demonstrate that monitoring is notrequired. The types of information that should be kept include: \n•  The source of the objective data,•  The testing protocol, results, and/or analysis of data,•  The exempted operation and corresponding information\nsupporting the exemption, and\n•  Any other data relevant to the operations, materials, processes,\nor employee exposures covered by the exemption.\n10\nIDo I need to collect initial personal monitoring samples for\nevery single employee, on every work shift?\nNo. But you do need to determine the exposure level of every\nemployee. If you have only one employee, or just a few who all dodifferent jobs, you need to collect personal samples for eachemployee. However, if you have two or more employees who dothe same job, you may be able to collect personal samples for oneof these employees and use the results to document exposurelevels for all of these employees. This is known as representativesampling. To decide whether the results for one employee willrepresent the EtO exposure of other employees in the group, youmust evaluate certain criteria (see “Criteria for Using Results fromSimilar Work Conditions” text box). \nIf the answer is “no” to any of the questions, you probably need\nto compare a smaller and more similar group of employees, orconduct individual personal monitoring for each employee. If theanswer to all of these questions is “yes,” you may use the resultsfrom one or more employee to represent the exposure of otheremployees in the group. However, you must select the employeewho is likely to have the highest EtO exposure (due to slightvariations in work area, work practices, or experience). \nCriteria for Using Results from Similar Work Conditions\n•  Do the employees do the same work?\n•  Are their working conditions similar (for example, do the\nemployees use similar equipment and EtO products?)\n•  Do the employees have similar work practices, with similar\nEtO control measures?\n•  Do they work in the same area or in areas with similar air\nmovement patterns?\n•  Do the employees use the same EtO product for the same\namount of time during their shifts?\n•  Do the employees work the same distance from possible\nsources of EtO?\n11\nYou must also keep a record stating your reasons for selecting\nan employee from one work shift to represent employees onanother shift.  One way to document the similarity of shifts is bysampling employees on each shift one time to show that theemployee exposures are the same on each shift. If the exposuresare the same, you can conduct future required periodic samplingon a single shift and consider it representative of all shifts. You mayuse this option with 8-hour samples and with 15-minute samples. \nIAm I permitted to use results of air samples collected at anothertime or at a different location from my initial monitoring results?\nYes, but the work conditions must have been similar on the two\ndates, or at the two locations. The text box “Criteria for UsingResults from Similar Work Conditions” also applies in this situation.Again, if the answer is “no” to one or more of the questions, it islikely that you must conduct initial monitoring. If the answer is“yes,” then OSHA allows you to meet the initial monitoring require-ments by using personal monitoring results collected for otheremployees at an earlier date or at a different location in theworkplace. Be sure to keep a document explaining why it wasappropriate to use those results.\nIWhich 15-minute period should I monitor? \nYou must collect a 15-minute air sample during the portion of the\nwork shift when you think that the employee’s EtO exposure will bethe highest. You may need to collect several 15-minute samplesduring the same shift (see text box “Why Is It So Important toCollect 15-Minute Samples?”).\nWhy Is It So Important to Collect 15-Minute Samples?\nResearch suggests that EtO exposures above the 15-minute\nOSHA PEL continue to occur in workplaces that are involvedin processing, using, or handling products containing EtO.Recent studies have also shown that personal monitoringactivities often fail to detect accidental exposures during EtO \n12\nleaks and spills (Lamontagne et al., 2004; Lamontagne and\nKelsey 1998). Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the types of activities for which 15-minute monitoring aremost useful. The following examples should provide someguidance:\n•  A common situation in which accidental exposures to EtO \nmight occur involves changing EtO supply cylinders.Consider collecting 15-minute personal samples while theemployees being sampled are replacing EtO cylinders.\n•  Employees who work directly with, or in close proximity to,\nEtO sterilizers or similar equipment should be monitoredfrequently for short-term (i.e., 15-minute) exposures toEtO at the times when they are most likely to experience\nexposure (such as when the employee opens the door atthe end of the cycle, or while EtO is being pumped in orout of the equipment).\nPeriodic Monitoring\nIDo I need to repeat the EtO personal monitoring and, if so, whatis the monitoring schedule?\nThe answer depends on the results of initial personal monitoring\nfor EtO. Under certain situations, a long-term schedule for personalmonitoring for EtO must be established. Tables 1 and 2 provide the“periodic monitoring” schedule required by the EtO standard. Thepersonal monitoring results might also trigger other requirementsthat are listed in Tables 3 and 4, which appear later in this guidancedocument.\nT able 1 – Schedule for OSHA Exposure Monitoring\nIf your initial employee monitoring \nresults… Then…\n…show that employee exposure is Discontinue monitoring for only those\nbelow the 8-hour action level, employees whose exposures are \nrepresented by the initial monitoring.\n13\n14If your initial employee monitoring \nresults… Then…\n…are between the 8-hour action level Conduct additional 8-hour personal\n(0.5 ppm) and the 8-hour permissible exposure monitoring at least every exposure limit (PEL) of 1 ppm 6 months.(including the value 0.5 ppm),\n…are above the 8-hour PEL of 1 ppm Conduct additional personal exposure\nor above the 15-minute PEL of 5 ppm, monitoring (either 8-hour or 15-\nminute, depending on the sample typethat initially exceeded the limit) at least every 3 months.\nT able 2 – Requirements for Discontinuing Monitoring\nIf your periodic employee monitoring results had been above the PEL (either the 8-hour TWA or the 15-minute excursion limit) and… Then…\n…are now between the 8-hour action You can decrease the 8-hour personal \nlevel (0.5 ppm) and the 8-hour PEL of monitoring frequency from every 3 1 ppm (including the value 0.5 ppm) months to every 6 months.

Examples ofchanges that should be evaluated to determine if they may result innew or additional exposures and, therefore, would trigger resumingEtO sampling include:\n•  Changing EtO process equipment or increasing the volume\nof EtO used,\n•  Modifying the exhaust ventilation system,•  Hiring new or inexperienced employees, and•  Changing work practices. \nYou also must resume sampling any time that you have a\nreason to suspect that such a change may result in new oradditional exposures.\nActions Triggered by Air Sample Results\nII received air sampling results; now what do I do?\nTables 3 and 4 provide the lists of actions you need to take as a\nresult of EtO monitoring results that exceed specific levels. Theseactions are based on the OSHA action level and/or PELs (8-hourand/or 15-minute samples). \nT able 3 – Actions T riggered by Air Sample Results\nResult interpretation: 8-hour sample 8-hour sample 15-minute Other OSHA  \nis equal to or is above sample is Standards above Action Permissible above that Apply**Level Level Excursion \nLimit\nResult value: 0.5 ppm or Above 1 ppm Above 5 ppm\ngreater\nAction T riggered by Monitoring ResultsProvide medical Yes Yes Not required 1910.1020\nsurveillance (if employee’s exposure is more than 30 days per year)*\nProvide information Yes Yes Yes –\nand training\n15\nEstablish a Not required Yes Yes, also if –\nregulated area expected to \nexceed this level\nTake steps to reduce Not required Yes Yes –\nexposure levels with engineering controls or other methods\nDevelop and put Not required Yes Yes --\ninto action a written compliance program for reducing exposure and establishing a schedule for periodic leak detection\nProvide respirators Not required Yes Yes 1910.134Ensure that caution Yes Yes Yes 1910.1200\nlabels are fixed to containers (also when container contents are capable of causing or can be reasonably foreseen to cause these exposure levels)\nEstablish periodic  Yes, at least Yes, at least Yes, at least 1910.1020\nair monitoring every 6 every 3 every 3programs months months months\n* Medical examinations are also required if there is an exposure related to \nan emergency situation.** For information on OSHA standards that apply, see the text box titled“Important References to OSHA Standards”.\nT able 4 – Actions T riggered by the Air Sampling Process\nOther Actions T riggered by When to T ake Action Other OSHA Air Monitoring Standards\nthat Apply*\nPost monitoring results Any time that samples are 1910.1020\nwithin 15 days of receiving collected – regardless of the them, or give employees the resultswritten results.

These methods may be appropriate inaddition to, but not instead of, personal air monitoring. Theycannot be used as a substitute for personal monitoring to satisfyOSHA personal air monitoring requirements.\nEmergency Situations\nThe OSHA EtO standard requires that a written plan for eachworkplace be developed for emergency situations. (See also§1910.38 Emergency Action Plans and §1910.39 Fire PreventionPlans.)\nEmergency Plan for EtO\nThe following are some simple steps to ensure that your workplacemeets the emergency plan requirements in OSHA’s EtO standard:\nIFor employers with more than 10 employees, the emergencyplan must be in writing and available to employees. If you have10 or fewer employees, the plan may be communicated verballyto employees.\nIThe plan must include procedures for emergency evacuation,including type of evacuation and exit route assignments (refer toOSHA’s standard for “Emergency Action Plans” , listed in the textbox on Important References to OSHA Standards at page 22).Although not specifically required, you can be proactive in\n17\n18emergency planning pr eparations by conducting employee\nevacuation drills for potential EtO emergencies.\nIYou must have a system for alerting employees to emergency\nEtO exposures. You do have the flexibility to choose anyeffective method of alerting employees to potential EtO releasesthat could result in harmful exposures.  \nIThe plan must specifically provide that employees engagedin correcting emergency conditions shall be equipped withrespiratory protection as required by §1910.1047(g) until theemergency is abated and must be implemented in accordancewith §1910.134, Respiratory Protection.\nEmergency Alert Provision\nThe emergency alert provision of OSHA’s EtO standard allowsemployers to choose the most effective method of alertingemployees across industries. As part of the emergency plan, youmust develop a system for alerting your employees. The precisetype of alert system is not specified in the OSHA EtO standard.\nOSHA considers the following alert methods acceptable for an\nEtO monitoring system:\nIA bell or other alarm system:A bell or alarm system musthave a distinctive signal toalert employees to an EtOleak (refer to §1910.165,Employee Alarm Systems).\nIA voice-activated system:Like other alarm types, thissystem must have adistinctive signal to alertemployees to an EtO leak.\nIVoice communications: For\nthose employers with 10 orfewer employees in aparticular workplace, therequirements underMonitoring Systems\nAlarm systems basically function as a\nmonitor to test the surrounding air forEtO levels. \nTo monitor EtO levels near sterilizers,\nsome employers find it convenient toinstall a wall-mounted, or equipment-mounted system.\nCommercially available alarms that\nmonitor EtO levels and use both visualand sound alarms can alert employeesin noisy or crowded areas when thelevel of EtO is higher than it should be. \nMore information about some specific\ntypes of monitoring devices can befound at page 20 under “AdditionalSources of Information”. \n19“Employee alarm systems” states that direct voice communica-\ntion is an acceptable method of alerting employees, providingthat all employees at their respective workstations can clearlyhear the person’s voice. For workplaces with more than 10employees, simple voice communication is not acceptable.\nIIs there a specific EtO level that I should use to trigger an alert?\nOSHA has not established an “alert” level; you should choose an\nalert trigger level that is appropriate for your workplace. Whenevaluating alarms, it is important to remember that the alarm’spurpose is to alert employees to unintended and hazardous EtOreleases, rather than to average concentrations measured over an8-hour work shift. It is not necessary to base the EtO alarm triggerspecifically on the OSHA action level (0.5 ppm) or permissibleexposure limits for 8 hours (1 ppm) or 15 minutes (5 ppm). \nYou should also be aware that there is a large range in the cost\nand sensitivity of commercially available monitors. Some systemsalert employees to EtO levels greater than 20 ppm, while otherhighly sensitive monitoring devices can trigger an alarm at muchlower levels, such as 1 ppm or even lower (NIOSH, 1989). \nResearchers suggest that alarms that alert employees to\naccidental EtO spills or leaks can be reasonably set to levels of 20 ppm without compromising employee health and safety(Lamontagne and Kelsey, 1998).\nHow to Get Help with Air Monitoring\nIf you need help with air monitoring, contact the OSHA On-SiteConsultation Services office for your area which can be searched bylocation, at http://www.osha.gov/dcsp/smallbusiness/consult_directory.html. This service is often free of charge to employers.Alternatively, you can hire an “industrial hygienist” consultant whospecializes in workplace air monitoring. These consultants are oftenlisted in the telephone directory under the headings for environ-mental monitoring or assessment. The American Industrial Hygiene\nAssociation (AIHA) website also maintains a list of industrial\nhygiene consultants which can be searched by location, atwww.aiha.org.\nLaboratories provide analytical services and sometimes advise\nemployers on selecting air sampling equipment and test media.Some laboratories provide the media or loan the equipment as partof the analysis package. Laboratories that analyze workplace airsamples are typically listed in the telephone directory (environmen-tal – analysis) and also on the AIHA website. When selecting alaboratory, one important question to ask is “Does your laboratorymeet the accuracy requirements of OSHA’s Ethylene Oxidestandard?”  OSHA’s accuracy requirements can be found in§1910.1047(d)(6).\nAdditional Sources of Information \nU.S. Navy web link that provides information about selecting EtOsterilizer alarm systemshttp://p2library.nfesc.navy.mil/P2_Opportunity_Handbook/3_VII_2.html\nEthylene Oxide (EtO) Information\nEnvironmental Monitoring Technology (EMT).

An overall commitment to workplace safety and healthcan add value to your business, to your workplace and to your life.\nSafety and Health Program Management Guidelines\nEffective management of employee safety and health protection isa decisive factor in reducing the extent and severity of work-relatedinjuries and illnesses and their related costs. In fact, an effectivesafety and health program forms the basis of good employeeprotection and can save time and money (about $4 for everydollar spent), increase productivity, and reduce employee\ninjuries, illnesses and related workers’ compensation costs.\nTo assist employers and employees in developing effective\nsafety and health programs, OSHA published recommended Safety\nand Health Program Management Guidelines (54 Federal Register\n(16): 3904-3916, January 26, 1989). These voluntary guidelinesapply to all places of employment covered by OSHA.\nThe guidelines identify four general elements critical to the\ndevelopment of a successful safety and health managementprogram:\nIManagement leadership and employee involvement.\nIWork analysis.\nIHazard prevention and control.\nISafety and health training.\nThe guidelines recommend specific actions, under each of \nthese general elements, to achieve an effective safety and healthprogram.  The Federal Register notice is available online at\nwww.osha.gov.  \nState Programs\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) en-\ncourages states to develop and operate their own job safety and\n23\nhealth plans. OSHA approves and monitors these plans.  Twenty-\nfour states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands currently operateapproved state plans: 22 cover both private and public (state andlocal government) employment; Connecticut, New Jersey, NewYork and the Virgin Islands cover the public sector only. States andterritories with their own OSHA-approved occupational safety andhealth plans must adopt standards identical to, or at least aseffective as, the Federal standards. \nConsultation Services\nConsultation assistance is available on request to employers whowant help in establishing and maintaining a safe and healthfulworkplace. Largely funded by OSHA, the service is provided at nocost to the employer. Primarily developed for smaller employerswith more hazardous operations, the consultation service is de-livered by state governments employing professional safety andhealth consultants. Comprehensive assistance includes an appraisalof all mechanical systems, work practices and occupational safetyand health hazards of the workplace and all aspects of the em-ployer’s present job safety and health program. In addition, theservice offers assistance to employers in developing and imple-menting an effective safety and health program. No penalties areproposed or citations issued for hazards identified by the con-sultant. OSHA provides consultation assistance to the employerwith the assurance that his or her name and firm and any infor-mation about the workplace will not be routinely reported to OSHAenforcement staff.\nUnder the consultation program, certain exemplary employers\nmay request participation in OSHA’s Safety and HealthAchievement Recognition Program (SHARP). Eligibility for participa-tion in SHARP includes receiving a comprehensive consultationvisit, demonstrat ing exemplary achievements in workplace safety\nand health by abating all identified hazards and developing anexcellent safety and health program.\nEmployers accepted into SHARP may receive an exemption\nfrom programmed inspections (not complaint or accident investiga-tion inspections) for a period of one year. For more informationconcerning consultation assistance, see the OSHA website atwww.osha.gov.\n24\nVoluntary Protection Programs (VPP)\nVoluntary Protection Programs and on-site consultation services,\nwhen coupled with an effective enforcement program, expandemployee protection to help meet the goals of the OSH Act. The three levels of VPP are Star, Merit, and Star Demonstrationdesigned to recognize outstanding achievements by companiesthat have successfully incorporated comprehensive safety andhealth programs into their total management system. The VPPsmotivate others to achieve excellent safety and health results in thesame outstanding way as they establish a cooperative relationship\nbetween employers, employees and OSHA.\nFor additional information on VPP and how to apply, contact the\nOSHA regional offices listed at the end of this publication.\nStrategic Partnership Program\nOSHA’s Strategic Partnership Program, the newest member ofOSHA’s cooperative programs, helps encourage, assist andrecognize the efforts of partners to eliminate serious workplacehazards and achieve a high level of employee safety and health.Whereas OSHA’s Consultation Program and VPP entail one-on-onerelationships between OSHA and individual worksites, moststrategic partnerships seek to have a broader impact by buildingcooperative relationships with groups of employers and em-ployees. These partnerships are voluntary, cooperative relation-ships between OSHA, employers, employee representatives andothers (e.g., labor unions, trade and professional associations, universities and other government agencies).  \nFor more information on this and other cooperative programs,\ncontact your nearest OSHA office, or visit OSHA’s website atwww.osha.gov.\nAlliance Program\nThe Alliance Program enables organizations committed to work-place safety and health to collaborate with OSHA to prevent injuriesand illnesses in the workplace. OSHA and the Alliance participantswork together to reach out to, educate and lead the nation’semployers and their employees in improving and advancingworkplace safety and health. \n25\nGroups that can form an Alliance with OSHA include employers,\nlabor unions, trade or professional groups, educational institutionsand government agencies. In some cases, organizations may bebuilding on existing relationships with OSHA that were developedthrough other cooperative programs. \nThere are few formal program requirements for Alliances and\nthe agreements do not include an enforcement component. How-ever, OSHA and the participating organizations must define, im-plement and meet a set of short- and long-term goals that fall intothree categories: training and education; outreach and communica-tion; and promoting the national dialogue on workplace safety andhealth. \nOSHA Training and Education\nOSHA area offices offer a variety of information services, such ascompliance assistance, technical advice, publications, audiovisualaids and speakers for special engagements. OSHA’s  TrainingInstitute in Arlington Heights, IL, provides basic and advancedcourses in safety and health for Federal and state complianceofficers, state consultants, Federal agency personnel, and privatesector employers, employees and their representatives.\nThe OSHA Training Institute also has established OSHA Training\nInstitute Education Centers to address the increased demand for itscourses from the private sector and from other Federal agencies.These centers are nonprofit colleges, universities and other organi-zations that have been selected after a competition for participationin the program.\nOSHA also provides funds to nonprofit organizations, through\ngrants, to conduct workplace training and education in subjectswhere OSHA believes there is a lack of workplace training. Grantsare awarded annually. Grant recipients are expected to contribute20 percent of the total grant cost.\nFor more information on grants, training and education, contact\nthe OSHA Training Institute, Office of Training and Education, 2020South Arlington Heights Road, Arlington Heights, IL 60005, (847)297-4810 or see “Training” on OSHA’s website at www.osha.gov.For further information on any OSHA program, contact yournearest OSHA area or regional office listed at the end of thispublication.\n26\nInformation Available Electronically\nOSHA has a variety of materials and tools available on its website\nat www.osha.gov.
